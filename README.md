# ReportForge

A modern, block-based report editor built with React, TypeScript, and BlockNote for creating professional mining and geological reports..

## Features

### Document Navigation (Wayfinder)

The report editor includes a floating wayfinder menu that provides quick navigation to different sections of your document:

- **Floating Menu**: The menu follows you as you scroll through the document, staying visible when you're in the editor area
- **Smart Positioning**: Automatically aligns with the top of the editor and stays within the viewport
- **Outline View**: Click the menu icon in the floating toolbar to see a hierarchical outline of all headings in your document
- **Quick Navigation**: Click any section in the outline to instantly scroll to that part of the document
- **Smart Numbering**: Sections are automatically numbered (excluding special sections like "QP Certification", "Table of Contents", and "Disclaimer")
- **Keyboard Support**: Press `Escape` to close the wayfinder popup
- **Click Outside**: Click anywhere outside the popup to close it
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and hides on very small screens to prevent overlap

The wayfinder automatically updates as you add, remove, or modify headings in your document, providing a real-time overview of your document structure.

### Report Templates

- **NI 43-101 Reports**: Technical reports for mineral resources (Inferred, Indicated, Measured)
- **JORC Reports**: Mineral resource reports following JORC guidelines
- **Custom Templates**: Create your own report structures

### Rich Text Editing

- Block-based editing with drag & drop
- Real-time collaboration support
