    "title": "Summary",
    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 1.1 Introduction\n\nMoose Mountain Technical Services (MMTS) has prepared a NI43-101 Technical Report (the Report) on the New Polaris Gold Project (the Project) for Canagold Resource Corp (Canagold). The New Polaris Gold Project is in northwestern British Columbia (BC), about 100 km south of Atlin, BC, and 60 km northeast of Juneau, Alaska.\n\nSue Bird, P.Eng is the QP for Sections 1.1 through 1.9, 1.11, Sections 2 through 12 and Sections 14 through 24 and Sections 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, 25.5, 26.1, and 26.2.\n\nDeepak Malhotra is the QP for Sections 1.10, 13, 25.4 and 26.1.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.2 Terms Of Reference\n\nThe Report has been prepared in support of disclosures in Canagold's news release dated May 16 ${ }^{\\text {th }}$, 2023, entitled \"Canagold Increases Indicated resource by 89\\% in Updated Mineral resource Estimate for new Polaris Gold project, BC\".\n\nA Mineral Resource estimate and a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the Project was completed in 2007. The PEA was updated in 2009 and 2011, based on the same Mineral Resources from 2007, but updated gold prices and capital and operating cost estimates. An updated Mineral Resource Estimate and PEA was next done in 2019. An updated Mineral Resource estimate has been completed in 2023 which supersedes the previous studies and has been summarized into this report.\n\nUnits used in the report are metric units unless otherwise noted. Monetary units are in Canadian dollars (C\\$) unless otherwise stated.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.3 Project Setting\n\nNew Polaris (formerly Polaris-Taku Mine) is an early tertiary mesothermal gold mineralized body located in northwestern British Columbia about 100 km south of Atlin, BC and 60 km northeast of Juneau, Alaska (Error! Reference source not found.). The nearest roads in the area terminate 20 km south of Atlin, and approximately 100 km from the Project. Access at the present time is by aircraft. A short airstrip for light aircraft exists on the property. Shallow draft barges have been used in the past to access the site via the Taku River to transport bulk supplies and heavy equipment to site, as well as ship flotation concentrate from site.\n\nThe New Polaris project area lies on the eastern flank of the steep, rugged, Coast Range Mountains, with elevations ranging from sea level to 2,600 metres. The climate is one of heavy rainfalls during the late summer and fall months, and comparatively heavy snowfall, interspersed with rain during the winter.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.4 Mineral Tenure, Royalties And Agreements\n\nThe property consists of 61 contiguous Crown-granted mineral claims and one modified grid claim covering 1108 ha. All claims are 100\\% owned and held by New Polaris Gold Mines Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Canagold Resource Corp. subject to a 15\\% net profit interest held by Rembrandt Gold MinesLtd. Canagold can reduce this net profit interest to a 10\\% net profit by issuing 150,000 shares to Rembrandt.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.5 Geology And Mineralization\n\nThe deposit is composed of three sets of veins (quartz-carbonate stringers in altered rock), the \"A-B\" veins are northwest striking and southwest dipping, the \" $Y$ \" veins are north striking and dipping steeply east and finally the \"C\" veins are east-west striking and dipping to the south to southeast at $65^{\\circ}$ to vertical. The \"C\" veins appear to hook around to the north and south into the other two sets of veins so that their junctions form an arc. The gold is refractory and occurs dominantly in finely disseminated arsenopyrite grains that mineralize the altered wallrock and stockwork veins. The next most abundant mineral is pyrite, followed by minor stibnite and a trace of sphalerite. The zones of mineralization range from 15 to 250 metres in length and 0.3 to 14 metres in width.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.6 History\n\nThe deposit was mined by underground methods from 1938 to 1942, and from 1946 to early 1951, producing a total of 740,000 tonnes of ore at an average grade of $10.3 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ gold. Recent exploration work, since 1988, has been directed at gaining knowledge about the geology of the area and expanding the resource base of the mineralized zones. Geological mapping, geochemical surveys, geophysical techniques, and drilling have expanded the resources at the project.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.7 Drilling And Sampling\n\nCanarc (now Canagold) explored the \"C\" vein system between 1988 and 1997 and carried out infill drilling in 2003 through 2006 and in 2021 and 2022 to better define the continuity and grade of the vein systems. Sampling of the vein was done by wire line diamond drills using NQ-size rods. True widths of the mineralized zone vary from $70 \\%$ to $100 \\%$ of the drill core intercept angle.\n\nThe Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) program is similar for the above-mentioned programs in that samples were collected by employees of Canagold on site and shipped to ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver. For quality control and quality assurance, core samples were regularly mixed with blanks, duplicates, and standards. The program in the field was run in an efficient and proper manner following accepted engineering standards.\n\nSample preparation, analysis and security procedures undertaken by Canagold are generally performed in accordance with exploration best practices and industry standards. Sufficient verification checks have been undertaken on the databases to provide confidence that the databases are reasonably error free and may be used to support Mineral Resource estimation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.8 Mineral Resource Estimate\n\nAn updated Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared in 2023. The updated resource estimate uses all available drillhole data with historical data compared to and validated with recent drilling. The resource is based on 1,692 assay intercepts from 234 drill holes which intersect the veins within the data set. Inverse distance squared (ID2) has been used to interpolate the gold grade of the veins which were modelled by Moose Mountain Technical Services (MMTS) using Implicit modelling.The geologic continuity of the \" C \" vein system has been well established through historic mining and diamond drilling. Grade continuity has been quantified using semi-variograms, which are used to determine the distances (ranges) and directions of maximum continuity in the three principle directions. The ranges are used for Classification.\n\nThe classification to Indicated or Inferred required that the true thickness of the vein is at least 2 m . Classification is based primarily on anisotropic distances to drillholes with 50 m grid drill spacing being targeted. However, additional adjustments have been made to ensure a cohesive shape of Indicated material is produced, as summarized in Section 14.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.9 Mineral Resource Statement\n\nConfining shapes have been created targeting material above a series of cutoff grades.

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n2. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves.3. Resources are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards and were estimated using the 2019 CIM Best Practices Guidelines.\n4. The base case Mineral Resource has been confined by \"reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction\" shape using the following assumptions:\n\n- Metal prices of US\\$1,750/oz Au and Forex of 0.75 \\$US:\\$CDN;\n- Payable metal of $99 \\% \\mathrm{Au}$;\n- Offsite costs (refining, transport and insurance) of US\\$7/oz;\n- Mining cost of CDN\\$82.78/t ,\n- Processing costs of CDN\\$105.00/t and G\\&A and site costs of CDN\\$66.00/t.\n- Metallurgical Au recovery of $90.5 \\%$;\n\n5. The resulting Net Smelter Return equation is: NSR (CDN\\$/t)=Au*90.5\\%*US\\$74.72g/t;\n6. The specific gravity is 2.81 for the entire deposit;\n7. Numbers may not add due to rounding.\n\nThe QP is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate. Factors that may affect the estimates include: metal price assumptions, changes in interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of mineralization zones, changes to kriging assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions, operating cost assumptions, confidence in the modifying factors, including assumptions that surface rights to allow mining infrastructure to be constructed will be forthcoming, delays or other issues in reaching agreements with local or regulatory authorities and stakeholders, and changes in land tenure requirements or in permitting requirement.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.10 Metallurgy And Recovery Methods\n\nGold is associated with arsenopyrite and is refractory. Metallurgical test work has demonstrated that biooxidation (BIOX) and Carbon-in Leach (CIL) processing of flotation concentrate to produce doré results in an overall gold recovery of $90.5 \\%$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.11 Environmental, Permitting And Social Considerations\n\nThe Project is located within the land claim and traditional territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation (TRTFN). A collaborative agreement has been signed with TRTFN that formalizes the open and meaningful communications with the Project proponent that have been established and used for some time. TRTFN have indicated they support industrial projects within their traditional lands assuming Management Plans comply with their accepted policies and guidelines. Additional baseline data collection work required to meet regulatory requirements will be completed during the Feasibility and Permitting stages of the Project. The proponent will continue to engage and consult with TRTFN on all Project components and potential impacts.\n\nA program of Consultation and Engagement is also required for potentially affected Communities and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Project will be subject to permitting under British Columbia Environmental Assessments Office (BCEAO) as its production threshold exceeds the requirements for mining activities at a Provincial Level. Currently, it does not meet the trigger ( 5,000 tonnes per day) for a federal assessment through the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (IAAC). Additional consultations and input are also required from Alaska, United States authorities, as the rivers in the Project area drain into US waters (Transboundary Water).Some environmental studies have been initiated; however more work is required to meet regulatory requirements. Due to the time elapsed since collection, it is possible that a large portion of the current dataset will need to be refreshed to reflect existing conditions. Critical components of impact mitigation include Management Plans for land, water, air, and groundwater.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to expect approvals will be received conditional upon acceptance of respective Management Plans and commitments to mitigate impacts from operations."

    "text": "The New Polaris property consists of a group of 61 contiguous crown grants, and one modified grid claim totaling, 1108 ha located 96 km ( 60 miles) south of Atlin, BC and 64 km ( 40 miles) northeast of Juneau, Alaska. Located at approximately $133^{\\circ} 37^{\\prime}$ W Longitude and $58^{\\circ} 42^{\\prime} \\mathrm{N}$ Latitude, the deposit lies on the eastern flank of the Tulsequah River Valley, as illustrated in Figure 4-1\n\nThe claims are 100\\% owned and held by New Polaris Gold Mines Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Canagold Resources Ltd Rts (Canagold), and subject to a 15\\% net profit interest held by Rembrandt Gold Mines Ltd. (Rembrandt), which Canagold has the right to reduce to $10 \\%$ by issuing 150,000 shares to Rembrandt. Table 4-1 summarizes the claims and the locations are shown on Figure 4-1. Apart from the W.W. 1 claim, the claims are crown granted and are kept in good standing through annual tax payments. The W.W. 1 is a modified grid claim. The claim has sufficient work filed on it to keep it in good standing until February 4, 2024. The crown granted claims were legally surveyed in 1937.\n\nThe Polaris No. 1, Silver King No. 1, Silver King No. 5, Black Diamond, Lloyd, and Ant Fraction crown grants include the surface rights. Surface rights for the remainder of the property lie with the Crown.\n\nMining of the AB Vein system and to a lesser extent the $Y$ and $C$ veins was carried out during the 1930s to early 1950s. Much of the former infrastructure has been reclaimed. A $\\$ 249,000$ reclamation bond is in place, and it is the writer's opinion that this adequately covers the cost of reclaiming the original mill site and infrastructure. Currently there is no legal or regulatory requirement to remove or treat the tailings on the property.\n\nPrior to commencing further exploration on the property, a Notice of Work is required to be submitted to the Mining and Minerals Department of the BC Ministry of Energy and Mines. Work can only commence once approval has been received.\n\nAdditional exploration work carried out in 2021 to 2022 was covered by:\nMines Act Permit MX-1-208, Approval \\# 20-0100054-0911\nWater rights will need to be acquired from the Province of British Columbia for sources of water for mining, processing, and potable water during operations. Since a positive water balance prevails in the area, and plans include maximizing water recycling to minimize freshwater requirements, such approvals are generally granted, subject to acceptable conditions.\n\nTo the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title or right, or ability to perform proposed work on the Project.Table 4-1 List of Claims\n\n| Claim Name | Lot No. | Folio No. |  | Claim Name | Lot No. | Folio No. |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Polaris No. 1 | 6109 | 4472 |  | Snow | 3497 | 4545 |\n| Polaris No. 2 | 6140 | 5223 |  | Snow No. 2 | 3495 | 5088 |\n| Polaris No. 3 | 6141 | 5223 |  | Snow No. 3 | 3494 | 5495 |\n| Polaris No. 4 | 3498 | 4545 |  | Snow No. 4 | 3499 | 5495 |\n| Polaris No. 5 | 6143 | 5223 |  | Snow No. 5 | 6105 | 4472 |\n| Polaris No. 6 | 6144 | 5223 |  | Snow No. 6 | 6106 | 4472 |\n| Polaris No. 7 | 6145 | 5223 |  | Snow No. 7 | 3500 | 4472 |\n| Polaris No. 8 | 6146 | 5223 |  | Snow No. 8 | 6107 | 4472 |\n| Polaris No. 9 | 6147 | 5223 |  | Snow No. 9 | 6108 | 4472 |\n| Polaris No. 10 | 6148 | 5290 |  | Black Diamond | 3491 | 4472 |\n| Polaris No. 11 | 6149 | 5290 |  | Black Diamond No. 3 | 6030 | 4944 |\n| Polaris No. 12 Fr | 6150 | 5290 |  | Blue Bird No. 1 | 5708 | 4545 |\n| Polaris No. 13 Fr | 6151 | 5290 |  | Blue Bird No. 2 | 5707 | 4545 |\n| Polaris No. 14 | 6152 | 5290 |  | Lloyd | 6035 | 5010 |\n| Polaris No. 15 | 6153 | 5290 |  | Lloyd No. 2 | 6036 | 5010 |\n| Silver King No. 1 | 5489 | 4804 |  | Rand No. 1 | 6039 | 5010 |\n| Silver King No. 2 | 5490 | 4804 |  | Rand No. 2 | 6040 | 5010 |\n| Silver King No. 3 | 5493 | 4804 |  | Minto No. 2 | 6033 | 4944 |\n| Silver King No. 4 | 5494 | 4804 |  | Minto No. 3 | 6034 | 4944 |\n| Silver King No. 5 | 5491 | 4804 |  | Jumbo No. 5 | 6031 | 4944 |\n| Silver King No. 6 | 5492 | 4804 |  | Ready Bullion | 6032 | 4944 |\n| Silver King No. 7 | 5495 | 4804 |  | Roy | 6042 | 5088 |\n| Silver King No. 8 | 5717 | 4545 |  | Frances | 6041 | 5010 |\n| Silver Queen No. 1 | 6026 | 4545 |  | Eve Fraction | 6170 | 5495 |\n| Silver Queen No. 2 | 6027 | 4545 |  | Eve No. 1 Fraction | 6171 | 5495 |\n| Silver Queen No. 3 | 6028 | 4944 |  | P.T.

    "text": "The New Polaris project area lies on the eastern flank of the steep, rugged, Coast Range Mountains, with elevations ranging from sea level to 2,600 metres.\n\nExtensive glaciation was the dominant factor in topographic development. The Taku and Tulsequah Rivers are the most prominent topographic features with broad valleys bounded by steep mountains. Numerous tributary streams flow from valleys filled with glaciers. Most of the glaciers are fingers branching from the extensive Muir ice cap, lying to the northwest of the Taku River. The Tulsequah glacier, which terminates in the Tulsequah valley about 16 km north of the New Polaris mine site, is one of the largest glaciers in the immediate area. It forms a dam causing a large lake in a tributary valley that breaks through the ice barrier (Jakülhlaup) during the spring thaw every year, flooding the Tulsequah and Taku valleys below for three to five days.\n\nSmall aircraft provide site access from the nearest population centers in Atlin, BC, 100 km north of the Property, or Juneau, Alaska, 60 km southwest of the Property. A short airstrip for light aircraft exists on the property. The nearest roads in the area terminate 20 km due south of Atlin and 10 km southeast of Juneau. Shallow draft barges have been used in the past to access the site via the Taku River to transport bulk supplies and heavy equipment to site, as well as ship flotation concentration from site. The property can be operated year-round.\n\nThe climate is one of heavy rainfalls during the late summer and fall months, and comparatively heavy snowfall, interspersed with rain during the winter. The annual precipitation is approximately 1.5 m of which 0.7 m occurs as rainfall. The snow seldom accumulates to a depth greater than 1.5 m on the level. Winter temperatures are not severe and rarely fall below $-15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Summer temperatures, in July, average $10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ with daytime temperatures reaching the high $20^{\\prime}$ s on occasion. The vegetation is typical of northern temperate rain forest, consisting primarily of fir, hemlock, spruce and cedar forest on the hillsides and aspen and alder groves in the river valley.\n\nThere is sufficient land available within the mineral tenure held by Canagold for installations such as the process plant and related mine infrastructure. Surface rights for the areas covered by the Combined Storage Facility (CSF), and access road to the CSF, lie with the Crown and will need to be obtained from the Province of British Columbia."

    "text": "This section has been taken from the previous NI43-101 report done by MMTS (MMTS, 2019).\nFrom 1923 to 1925 the Big Bull and Tulsequah Chief properties were discovered along the east side of the Tulsequah River and opened the Taku River district. In 1930, Noah A. Timmins Corporation optioned some of the claims that make up the New Polaris property and then conducted trenching and diamond drilling in 1931. The trenching exposed several veins, of which 10 showed promising grades. A short exploration adit about 9 m long ( 30 feet) was also driven into the side of the hill and Timmins drilled 19 holes for a total of $1,615 \\mathrm{~m}$ ( 5,297 feet) but was unable to correlate the intersections and elected to drop the option in September 1932.\n\nThe Alaska Juneau Gold Mining Company then optioned the property and conducted underground exploration from the \"AJ\" (Alaska Juneau) adit. Alaska Juneau drove a total of 190 m of drifting ( 625 feet) and, although they intersected \"ore grade\" mineralization. They too had problems with correlation and dropped the property in the fall of 1934.\nH. Townsend and M.H. Gidel of the Anaconda Corporation examined the property in 1934, carefully mapping the showings. They concluded that commercial ore bodies existed even though these showed irregularity due to faulting. Samples were sent to Geo G Griswold in Butte, Montana, who obtained gold recoveries from flotation tests in the order of $88 \\%$.\nD.C. Sharpstone then secured an option on the property on behalf of Edward C. Congdon and Associates of Duluth, Minnesota. Congdon conducted 236 m ( 775 feet) of underground exploration in the \"AJ\" tunnel and collared 26 m ( 85 feet) into the Canyon adit. The Polaris-Taku Mining Company was then incorporated in 1936 to take over the property from Congdon. Polaris-Taku erected a 150-ton per day flotation mill in 1937 and mined underground continuously until it was closed in April 1942 due to labor restrictions brought on the Second World War. Mining operations resumed in April 1946 and continued until 1951 when the mine was closed due to high operating costs, a fixed gold price, and the sinking of a concentrate barge shipment during a storm in March 1951. Up to date, 231,604 oz. of gold was produced at a recovered grade of $0.3 \\mathrm{oz} /$ ton.\n\nAn Edwards Roaster and a cyanide plant to produce bullion were installed and tested in 1949 to improve recovery and reduce shipping cost of concentrates to the Tacoma smelter. The addition of the roaster helped improve milling economics, but its capacity was somewhat limited as it could treat only about $45 \\%$ of the concentrates produced from the flotation plant. After closure, the mill was leased to Tulsequah Mines Ltd. (owned by Cominco) who modified it to process 600 tpd of massive sulphide polymetallic ore (containing gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc) from the Tulsequah Chief and Big Bull Mines. Tulsequah Mines Ltd. used the mill from 1953 to 1957.\n\nNumalake Mines acquired the property in 1953, changed their name to New Taku Mines Ltd. (New Taku) and undertook rehabilitation work of the mine's plant. A negative feasibility study in 1973 halted this work. New Taku changed its name to Rembrandt Gold Mines Ltd. in 1974. The property lay idle until Suntac Minerals Corp. (Suntac) optioned the property in 1988 and started surface exploration. Canarc merged with Suntac in 1992 and acquired a 100\\% interest from Rembrandt in 1994, subject to a 15\\% net profit interest, which Canarc can reduce to 10\\%. Canarc's subsidiary, New Polaris Gold Mines Ltd.# Moose Mountain <br> Technical Services \n\n(formerly Golden Angus Mines Ltd.), currently operates the property. Work on the property since 1988 is discussed in later sections of this report."

    "text": "This section has been taken from the previous NI43-101 report done by MMTS (MMTS, 2019).\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 7.1 Regional Geology\n\nThe New Polaris Mine lies on the western edge of a large body of Upper Triassic Stuhini Group volcanic rocks, which has been intruded by a Jurassic-Cretaceous granodiorite body north of the mine. Older Triassic volcanic rocks and earlier sediments underlie the Stuhini volcanic rocks. The granodiorite is part of the Coast Plutonic Complex (Figure 7-1).\n\nThe structural trend in the area is northwest-southeast, paralleling major faults and folds to the east and intrusive alignment to the west. The Triassic volcanic rocks and older sedimentary rocks have been folded and sheared with the Stuhini Group rocks being deformed into broad to isoclinal, doubly plunging symmetrical folds with large amplitudes.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 7.2 Property Geology\n\nCanagold has carried out extensive mapping of the Polaris-Taku property since the early 1990's. The work has been done by several employees and contractors and is shown in Figure 7-2. The gold deposit is hosted within an assemblage of mafic (basalt and andesite units) volcanic rocks altered to greenschist metamorphic facies. The orientation of these units is inconclusive because there are no marker beds in the sequence. It is thought that the units are steeply dipping ( $70^{\\circ}$ to $80^{\\circ}$ ) to the north based on the orientation of the limestone/basalt interface at the southern portion of the property.\n\nA serpentinite unit is located to the northeast, which was identified in recent (1996/97) drilling and underground mapping. This unit appears to form the eastern extent of the mineralization. The age relationship is unclear, but it is assumed that the serpentinite is a later stage feature possibly associated with tectonism in the area.\n\nThe 'vein' zones are structurally controlled shear zones and are typified by silicification and carbonatization cross cutting actual quartz-carbonate veins. These zones have sharp contacts with the wall rock and form anastomosing ribbons and dilations. These zones have been deformed several times, which makes original textures difficult to determine. The zones are generally tabular in geometry forming en-echelon sheets within the more competent host lithologies.\n\nAll the strata within the property have been subjected to compression, rotation, and subsequent extension. The plunge of folds appears to be variable though generally shallow. Small-scale isoclinal folds strike north northwesterly and plunge moderately to the north. Numerous faults are found on the property, the more significant of which are discussed below.\n\nThe possible extension of the Llewellyn fault, termed the South Llewellyn fault, continues south from the Chief Cross fault along mine grid coordinate 4400 East. Slightly north of Whitewater Creek it is offset to the west by an east-west fault, the 101 fault, to continue in a more southeast orientation of the opposite side of Whitewater Creek. This northwest-southeast orientation structure was named the Limestone Fault due to its bedding parallel attitude within a discontinuous limestone/marble horizon. It marks the southwest boundary of the \"mine wedge\": the wedge-shaped package of rock within which all pastproduction took place. The northern boundary of the \"mine wedge\" is further defined as mentioned above by the Whitewater Creek Schist Zone, a zone of schistose chlorite-amphibolite-serpentinite less than 100 m thick. A complex network of brittle faults is also found within this zone.\n\nThree major faults, Numbers 1 and 5, and an unnamed fault, lie within the mine wedge. The No. 1 and No. 5 faults strike northwest-southeast, dipping approximately $45^{\\circ}$ to the northeast, and are sub-parallel to the unnamed fault, which dips steeply to the southwest. The No. 1 fault has reverse displacement of up to 30 m while the displacement of the No. 5 fault is poorly defined. The southwest dipping, unnamed fault showed no displacement, as it apparently parallels the A-B vein system. The mined-out areas indicate the wedge shape, the predominant orientations and continuity of the zones, and the overall plunge of the system to the southeast. An early interpretation of the structure showed that various veins appear to meet and form \"junction arcs\" where both thickness and grade improve.![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7-1 Regional Geology![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7-2 Property Geology\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 7.3 Mineralization\n\nMineralization of the New Polaris deposit bears strong similarities to many Archean lode gold deposits such as the arsenical gold camp of Red Lake, Ontario where the gold-bearing arsenopyrite is disseminated in the altered rock and in quartz-carbonate stringers.\n\nVein mineralization consists of arsenopyrite, pyrite, stibnite, and gold in a gangue of quartz and carbonates. The sulphide content is up to $10 \\%$ with arsenopyrite the most abundant and pyrite the next important. Stibnite is abundant in some specimens but overall comprises less than one-tenth of $1 \\%$ of the vein matter. Alteration minerals include fuchsite, silica, pyrite, sericite, carbonate, and albite.\n\nIn general, the zones of mineralization ranging from 15 to 250 m in length with widths up to 14 m appear to have been deposited only on the larger and stronger shears. Their walls pinch and swell showing considerable irregularity both vertically and horizontally. Gold values in the veins have remarkable continuity and uniformity and are usually directly associated with the amount of arsenopyrite present. The prominent strike directions are north-south and northwest-southeast, which is interpreted to be within a major shear zone. Up to $80 \\%$ of the mine production was from \"structural knots\" or what is now known as \"C\" zones. In detail the \"C\" zones are arcuate structures.\n\nFigure 7-3 shows a 3D view of the \"C\" vein system.\nThe vein mineralization has well marked contacts with the wall rock. The transition from mineralized to non-mineralized rock occurs over a few centimeters. The mineralization consists of at least three stages of quartz veining. The initial stage of quartz-ankerite introduced into the structure was accompanied by a pervasive hydrothermal alteration of the immediately surrounding wall rock. Arsenopyrite, pyrite and lesser stibnite were deposited with the alteration. Later stages of quartz-ankerite veining are barren and have the effect of diluting the gold grades in the structure. The sulphide minerals are very fine-grained and disseminated in both the wall rock and early quartz and ankerite veins. Free gold is extremely rare and to the end of 2005 had not been recognized in core samples. Much of the gold occurs in arsenopyrite and to a lesser extent in pyrite and stibnite. Because there is no visible gold, and the host sulphides are very fine-grained and disseminated there is little nugget effect and gold values even over short intervals rarely exceed $1 \\mathrm{oz} /$ ton.\n\nMineralization was observed by S. Bird during the site visit both in drill core and underground. The description of the regional setting, local geology, and mineralization appears applicable to the New Polaris project and is sufficiently well understood to support the estimation of Mineral Resources.![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n(Source: MMTS, 2023)\nFigure 7-3 3D Vein Model (colour=\"C\" veins, grey = \"Y\" veins)"

    "text": "The New Polaris deposit is classified as a mesothermal lode-gold deposit (Hodgson, 1993).\nIn general, it is quartz-vein-related, with associated carbonatized wall rocks. The deposits are characterized by a high gold/silver ratio, great vertical continuity with little vertical zonation, and a broadly syn-tectonic time of emplacement. They are commonly associated with pyrite, arsenopyrite, tourmaline and molybdenite. Mineralization may occur in any rock type and ranges in form from veins to veinlet systems, to disseminated replacement zones. Most mineralized zones are hosted by and always related to steeply dipping reverse- or oblique-slip brittle-fracture to ductile-shear zones.\n\nThe New Polaris project is orogenic lode gold deposits also known as Mesothermal vein deposits. Numerous examples of this type of deposit are known throughout the world including the Campbell Red Lake deposits in Ontario and the Bralorne deposit in British Columbia. Past exploration studies have demonstrated that the New Polaris vein systems have all the attributes of the orogenic vein gold deposit including, but not limited to association with major structural break, quartz-carbonate vein association, low-sulphide assemblage of pyrite and arsenopyrite, chloritic, and sericitically altered wall rocks and persistent gold mineralization over a vertical distance of nearly 1 km .\n\nThe deposit type and model are considered by the QP as appropriate for a Mesothermal lode-gold deposit."

The early exploration work in the area located gold mineralization on surface and subsequent exploration led to mining of approximately 689,500 tonnes of material grading $10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ gold. More recent exploration work, since 1988, has been directed at gaining knowledge about the geology of the area and expanding the resource base of the mineralized zones.\n\nGeological mapping, geochemical surveys, geophysical techniques, and drilling have added considerable value to the project. Table 9-1 lists the relevant exploration work on the property along with contractor name and supervisor.\n\nTable 9-1\nSummary of Exploration Employees / Contractors\n\n| Year | Supervisor | Drilling Contractors | Laboratory | Underground |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1988 | Cloutier |  | TSL |  |\n| 1989 | Cloutier |  | TSL |  |\n| 1990 | Cloutier |  | TSL |  |\n| 1991 | Marriott | Arctic | Min En/Chemex |  |\n| 1992 | Marriott | Arctic | Chemex |  |\n| 1993 | Marriott/Moors | Arctic | Chemex |  |\n| 1994 | Moors | Arctic/Falcon | Chemex |  |\n| 1995 | Moors | Arctic/Falcon | Chemex |  |\n| 1996 | Karelse/Watkinson | Advanced | Northern | Main Street |\n| 1997 | Karelse/Watkinson | Advanced | Northern | Main Street |\n| 2003 | Moors | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex |  |\n| 2004 | Moors/Aspinall | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex |  |\n| 2005 | Moors/Aspinall | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex |  |\n| 2006 | Moors/Cote | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex |  |\n\nSurface mapping, geochemistry, and geophysics over the \"mine wedge\" were completed by Orequest in 1988 and further surface mapping and geochemistry, on the \"north grid\" were completed in 1993 with results are shown in Figure 7-2.\n\nUnderground exploration included the rehabilitation of the AJ Level in 1988 and the rehabilitation of all the other levels, including the Polaris Portal, in 1996 and 1997.

    "title": "Drilling",
    "text": "Diamond drill programs were carried out on the New Polaris Project when the project was reactivated in 1988 until 2022 (Table 10-1). Initially, the drilling focused on the down dip and along strike extensions of the $Y$ veins. This work showed that the $Y$ veins, while good grade were narrow and less continuous than the $A B$ vein system.\n\nIn 1990, drilling shifted to the area beneath the lowest most $C$ vein stopes. This drilling found that the vein system continued to depth and that gold grades in the 0.30 to $0.45 \\mathrm{oz} /$ ton range over an average true thickness of 3 m were present. From 1991 to 1993 most of the drillholes tested the C veins with fewer drilled on the $Y$ vein system. Encouraging drill results from the $C$ veins and to a lesser extent from the $Y$ vein system led to further drilling on these two vein systems. Drilling on the $C$ vein showed the veins to be open to depth and to have gold grades that ranged from 0.2 to $0.6 \\mathrm{oz} /$ ton over true thicknesses of 3 m .\n\nIn 1996 and 1997 the $Y, C$ and $A B$ veins were explored from underground. The plan was to closely test the upper portions of the $Y, C$ and $A B$ veins to allow calculation of a resource that might form the basis for resumption of mining. The results of the underground drilling program were mixed. The underground workings were for the most part driven along the vein structures with few crosscuts from which holes could be drilled to cut the down dip and along strike extension of the veins. As a result, except for those holes that tested the area immediately below the workings, most cut the veins at shallow angles. The very shallow angles that in places approach parallel to the vein make the use of these intersections inappropriate for a resource calculation (An example is hole 97-44 that cut 34.1 m grading $0.42 \\mathrm{oz} / \\mathrm{ton}$ ). Despite the number of holes drilled during 1996 and 1997, the work did little to expand the extent of the mineralization in the $A B, C$ or $Y$ vein systems. The work confirmed that the mineralized shoots in the lower most stopes on the $Y$ and $C$ veins were open to depth.\n\nPoor market conditions after 1997 made financing of the New Polaris Project difficult. Drilling restarted on the property in 2003 with the objective of testing the extent of the $C$ vein mineralization. Canagold, undertook a review of the Polaris Project and recommended additional drilling to test the continuity of the \"C\" vein zone mineralization at depth below the lower most mine workings. To this end, limited drill programs were carried out from 2003 to 2006. The 2003 to 2006 exploration programs targeted the \"C\" vein extensions below the existing mine workings.\n\nIn 2021 to 2022 an additional two-phase drilling program was completed. Phase 1 was designed primarily to collect further details on the Inferred Resources of the C vein system, predominately in the West Main domain. The 52 infill drill holes had a target depth ranging between 300 m to 650 m and were designed to provide greater density of drill intercepts at approximately 25 m spacing along section lines. Two drill holes were considered abandoned with no attempt to re-drill. One very deep hole with two additional wedge holes was completed as part of the program to attempt to intersect the down dip projection of the CWM domain. The drilling confirmed the downdip extension of the C veins.\n\nPhase 2 of the 2021 to 2022 drilling program was designed primarily to collect further details on the inferred Resources of the Y Vein system. The 45 infill drill holes had a target depth ranging between 29 m to 749 m and were designed to provide greater density of drill intercepts. One of the drill holes was aimed# Moose Mountain Technical Services \n\nat intercepting the gap between two of the \"C\" veins and two holes were intended to infill the C East lenses.\n\nThe results of the 2021 to 2022 drilling of the \" C \" and \" Y \" vein systems confirmed the continuity of gold mineralization and the vein structure between the earlier drilled holes. As can be seen in the figures below, drill results show the \" C \" vein system to be an arc-like structure generally oriented east-west with a shift in strike in the west. The change in strike occurs across the No. 1 fault. To the east of the No. 1 fault, the vein splays into two or more branches. The dip of the vein system is to the south and southeast and has an average dip of about 500, although east of the No. 1 fault the vein appears to flatten and thicken in a sigmoid-like feature.\n\nA plan view of the collar locations for the drillhole used for the resource estimate are plotted on Figure 10-2. A representative long section plots showing the pierce points of drillholes, and grades of the relevant drilling is presented in Figure 10-2.\n\nAll the holes in this period were drilled from surface and intersected a similar geologic sequence. From the collar, the holes penetrated 15 m to 79 m of overburden followed by inter-layered ash and lapilli tuff, volcanic wacke, and foliated andesite. The \"C\" vein system crosscuts the strike of the volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks at steep angles.\n\nTable 10-1 Diamond Drillhole Summary (1988 to 2022)\n\n| Year | Supervisor | Drilling Contractors | Laboratory | Number of <br> Collars | Total Length <br> Drilled (m) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $<1988$ |  |  |  | 778 | $32,483.05$ |\n| 1988 | Cloutier |  | TSL | 8 | $1,027.79$ |\n| 1989 | Cloutier |  | TSL | 21 | $4,490.75$ |\n| 1990 | Cloutier |  | TSL | 9 | $2,862.46$ |\n| 1991 | Marriott | Arctic | Min En/Chemex | 11 | $3,436.77$ |\n| 1992 | Marriott | Arctic | Chemex | 21 | 5695.40 |\n| 1993 | Marriott/Moors | Arctic | Chemex | 7 | $1,142.39$ |\n| 1994 | Moors | Arctic/Falcon | Chemex | 29 | $5,719.89$ |\n| 1995 | Moors | Arctic/Falcon | Chemex | 17 | $7,572.76$ |\n| 1996 | Karelse/Watkinson | Advanced | Northern | 24 | $3,204.69$ |\n| 1997 | Karelse/Watkinson | Advanced | Northern | 43 | $7,210.84$ |\n| 2003 | Moors | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex | 3 | $1,560.89$ |\n| 2004 | Moors/Aspinall | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex | 11 | $2,766.99$ |\n| 2005 | Moors/Aspinall | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex | 9 | $2,389.63$ |\n| 2006 | Moors/Cote | Hy-Tech | ALS Chemex | 72 | $24,801.60$ |\n| 2021 | McLaughlin/Dupuis | ITL Diamond Drilling Ltd | ALS <br> Geochemistry | 52 | $25,512.28$ |\n| 2022 | Dupuis/Smith | ITL Diamond Drilling Ltd | ALS <br> Geochemistry | 45 | $14,324.40$ |![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n(Source: MMTS, 2023)\nFigure 10-1 Plan view of Drillhole Locations by Year![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n(Source: MMTS, 2023)\nFigure 10-2 Section of the Drillholes and Vein Modelling (+/- 50m)"

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 11.1 Sample Method And Approach\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.1.1 Year 2003 - 2006\n\nDrilling of the vein was done by wire line diamond drills using NQ-size rods. Drill collar locations were surveyed in by total station surveying method. Drilling azimuth and dip were set using a Brunton compass and inclinometer. Routine downhole measurements of azimuth and dip were not done on the three holes drilled in 2003 and prior. In 2004, three different downhole survey systems were tried before settling on a Reflex system. The Reflex system was also used in 2005. The downhole surveying was operated by the Hytech drill crew. This information was input to a GEMCOM program to plot the location of the collar and the pierce point of the veins.\n\nCore recovery was very good and ranged from the low $90 \\%$ to nearly $100 \\%$ and is a fair sampling of the mineralization at the point where the drillhole pierced the vein.\n\nDetermining intervals of core for sampling was done by the geologist during logging of the core. The mineralized vein structures were marked out. Selections of core intervals for sampling were based in the presence of veining and sulphide mineralization, particularly arsenopyrite. Within the defined vein structure sample intervals ranged from 0.3 m to 1.5 m . Divisions were based on intensity of mineralization and veining. Sampling of the core over several metres on either side of the mineralized vein structures was also done to the point where hydrothermal alteration disappeared. No sampling of core from the unaltered rock was done.\n\nThe core was logged and stored in the camp. Access to the core was only available to the geologists and the core sampler. The core was brought from the drill to the logging facility by the geologist at the end of each shift. The core was geologically logged, recoveries calculated, and samples marked out in intervals of 0.5 to 1.0 m . The core was handed to the sample cutter who cut it with a diamond saw. Each sample was individually wrapped in plastic bags for shipment. The sample intervals were easily identified and correlate well with the drill logs.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.1.2 Years 2021-2022\n\nDuring the 2021 to 2022 drilling program the core was geologically logged to identify the gold mineralized zones that were allocated unique sample number tickets and marked for cutting using a purpose-built diamond blade rock saw. Half core samples were collected in labelled bags and the other half remains in the original core box stored on site. Quality control (QC) samples including certified reference material standards, blanks and duplicates were inserted into the sample sequence at intervals of one in ten on a rotating basis to monitor laboratory performance and provide quality assurance (QA) of the assay results. Several sample bags were transported together in rice bags with unique numbered security tags attached and labelled with company and lab contact information to ensure sample security and chain of custody during shipment to the lab.\n\nThe samples were submitted to the ALS Geochemistry lab in Whitehorse, YT in 2021 and Yellowknife, NT 2022 for preparation and assaying. The entire sample was crushed to $70 \\%$ passing -2 millimeters and a 250-gram aliquot is split and pulverized to $85 \\%$ passing -75 microns. Analysis for gold was by 30-gram fireassay and gravimetric finish. A suite of 30 other elements including arsenic, antimony, sulfur and iron is analyzed by aqua-regia digestion Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). ALS Canada Ltd. is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada and is an ISO/IEC 9001:2015 and 17025:2017 certified analytical laboratory in North America.\n\nThe procedures for sample preparation, analysis and security procedures follow accepted engineering standards and the quality of gold analytical data collected by Canagold is sufficiently reliable to support Mineral Resource estimation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.2 Qaqc - 2003-2006\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.2.1 Blanks - 2003-2006\n\nFor the QA/QC program in these years, the samples were collected by employees of Canagold on site and shipped to ALS Chemex laboratory in Vancouver. For quality control and quality assurance, core samples were regularly mixed with blanks, duplicates, and standards. The program in the field was run in an efficient and proper manner following accepted engineering standards.\n\nBlank samples represent material from the old mine, which is known to have a very low gold value. In total 56 blank samples were assayed.

    "text": "The QP, Sue Bird visited the property on the $25^{\\text {th }}$ of August 2022. At the time of the site visit core logging procedures from the 2022 program were examined, a general overview of the property was completed, including selected drill sites, historic core, an underground tour, and the condition of existing project infrastructure.\n\nWhile on the property, the author along with the chief geologist, Troy Gill, P.Geo. examined underground workings to confirm the nature of the mineralization, as well as the dimensions and extent of the vein system. The author also viewed a selection of core from key holes drilled from the early 1990's to the end of 2006 and compared his observations with those documented in the drill logs. In both the case of the underground workings and the core, the author found that his observations confirmed what was recorded in logs and sections. The author also confirmed that core had been properly cut and stored.\n\nThe core logging facility was clean and orderly. The system of check assaying is adequate. The only issue that the author has with the system is the use of quartered core for the duplicate samples. The sample size difference between the quartered and half core may account in part for the high relative difference between the original sample and the duplicate. In future, resubmission of pulps on a blind basis should be carried out to help separate variance caused by analysis from that due to sample size or bias cutting of the core.\n\nIn addition to the site visit, a detailed review of the database was completed. Forty-one drillholes were selected from the C vein area, and the drill logs and assay sheets were compared with the database. Only minor differences were observed between the hard copy material and the database. Also, the input of the database into the geology and resource modeling software was also checked.\n\nThe quality control systems in place prior to the 2003 program are poorly documented but seem to follow the norms of that period. Of concern is the way the collar locations of drillholes were determined. Most of the holes were located using Brunton compass and chaining. Also, the down hole surveying was not consistently done. As a result, the exact location of the vein intersections is not as certain as those from the drilling after 2003. Some re-drilling of older holes is recommended, especially where there are discrepancies with respect to the vein location between the recently drilled holes and those drilled in the 1990's.\n\nTo further validate the drillhole database, comparisons have been made of the results by year. As illustrated in Figure 12-1, the capped Au grades do not indicate any bias based on year drilled except possibly the pre-1988 holes. However, these holes are all within the high grade central portion of the deposit and drilled from underground so are expected to be higher grade. Therefore, a point validation has been completed to compare drillhole assays only within 20 m of the 1988 data.

A rod mill was used, and grinding was conducted at $50 \\%$ solids for 20 to 60 minutes. The slurry was wet-screened with a 400 -mesh screen, then dried and dryscreened. Results of these tests show that grinding will take approximately 37 minutes to obtain a $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.

The work index was calculated based on a closing screen size of 105 microns.\n\nThe calculated work index was 19.6 kWh/tonne. The ore is therefore considered to be relatively hard.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.5.2 Diagnostic Leach\n\nFor a diagnostic leach test, 1000 g of bulk sample were ground to a $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and screened so that $100 \\%$ of the material passed through $105 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.

Analysis of the concentrate produced by Test 4 shows that approximately $7.5 \\%$ of the material releases $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, indicating that the concentrate has approximately $15 \\%$ carbonate content.

Other conditions are as follows:\n\n- Rougher Tails (from Test 4): 48-hour leach, $40 \\%$ solids,\n- Rougher Tails (from Test 7): 24-hour leach, $40 \\%$ solids,\n- Cleaner Tails (from Test 8): 24-hour leach, $25 \\%$ solids.\n\nResults of these tests are given in Table 13-11.\nTable 13-11 Leach Test Results - Adapted from RDI 2003\n\n| Sample Leached | Calc.

It is not economical to leach the tails from either the rougher or cleaner stages with out oxidation of the sulphides.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.5.8 Rougher Concentrate Production\n\nRDI also conducted a series of six rougher flotation tests to produce concentrate for future testing. Each test used 10 kg of material, and obtained three froths per test, using 8 minutes, 5 minutes, and 8 minutes for the float times. Each test used $180 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $500 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$ during the grind, $250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ after the first two floats, and $45 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC. Overall, 12 kg of concentrate were produced. Assay results are given in Table 13-12.\n\nTable 13-12 Rougher Concentrate Production Analysis - Adapted from RDI 2003\n\n| Lab Assayed | Recovery (\\% of initial feed) |  |  |  | Assay Value |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Wt. | Au | As | S | $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ | Au (g/t) | As (\\%) | S (\\%) | $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\%)$ |\n| RDI | 19.5 | 98.6 | 88.1 | 98.1 |  | 91.98 | 12.80 | 21.1 |  |\n| Mintek |  |  |  |  |  | 89.9 | 14.3 | 19.7* |  |\n| RDI |  |  |  |  |  | 91.84 | 14.72 | 20.3 | 3.4 |\n| Oxidor |  |  |  |  |  | 93.96 |  |  |  |\n\n* Sulphide value\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.6 Mintek 2003\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.6.1 Cyanidation - Cil Tests\n\nAs part of the \"diagnostic leach\" tests, a direct cyanide leach with carbon was conducted to gain a baseline value for gold extraction from the rougher concentrate produced at RDI in 2003. The 24 -hour leach used \"excess reagents\" including $5 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{NaCN}$, and $20 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ activated carbon.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.6.2 Diagnostic Leach\n\nThree individual tests were performed on the rougher concentrate produced at RDI in 2003. The first test, a direct cyanide leach, has already been described above. The other two tests are described here:\n\n- Dilute Nitric acid ( $10 \\% \\mathrm{w} / \\mathrm{w}, 70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 4$ hours) + CIL ( $20 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ activated carbon, $5 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{NaCN}, 24$-hour leach),\n- Concentrated Nitric acid ( $27.5 \\% \\mathrm{w} / \\mathrm{w}, 70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 4$ hours) + CIL ( $20 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ activated carbon, $5 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{NaCN}$, 24 -hours),\n- A repeat test with excess cyanidation reagents: $20 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ activated carbon, $50 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{NaCN}, 24$-hours.\n\nResults of all three tests are given in Table 13-13.Table 13-13 Results of Diagnostic Leach - Adapted from Mintek 2003\n\n| Test | Dissolution (\\%) |  | Au Extraction (\\%) | NaCN consumption (kg/t) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Sulphide | Arsenic |  |  |\n| Direct CIL | 0 | 0 | 17.6 | 2.7 |\n| Dilute $\\mathrm{HNO}_{3}+$ CIL | 26 | 42.5 | 60.3 | 4.85 |\n| Conc. $\\mathrm{HNO}_{3}+$ CIL | 96.3 | 97.6 | 71.9 | 4.9 |\n|  |  |  | 93.7 | 49.3 |\n\nBaseline CIL resulted in only $17.6 \\%$ gold recovery, whereas concentrated Nitric acid resulted in $71.9 \\%$ recovery. With excess NaCN , the gold recovery value increases to $93.7 \\%$. The diagnostic leach confirmed the need for sulphide oxidation before leaching.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.6.3 Bio-Leach Tests\n\nThree bio-leaching tests were undertaken by Mintek: one control test and 2 bio-leach tests. Each test used the following conditions: $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 10 \\%$ solids, pH 1.8 solution, air enriched with $0.3 \\% \\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, \"OK\" nutrient broth, and the two non-control tests used mesophilic bacteria taken from maintenance reactors. For each test, the levels of aqueous iron and arsenic were measured, along with pH , redox potential, and dissolved oxygen in solution.\n\nThe control test showed steady levels of iron and arsenic in solution ( $5 \\% \\mathrm{Fe}, 4 \\% \\mathrm{As}$ ), and required $133 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t}$ of acid to maintain pH . Dissolution of both elements throughout the test was slow since there was no bacterial culture to oxidize the concentrate.\n\nFor Bioleach test 1, the pH lowered throughout the test, but required $150 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t}$ of acid. Aqueous arsenic steadily increased throughout the test, reaching $93.2 \\%$ dissolution. Aqueous iron slowly increased at first, but eventually reached $81.3 \\%$ dissolution. This slow dissolution was thought to be due to an inhibitory substance that prevented bacteria from growing at first. For the second test, acetone and ferric prewashes were used to try to resolve this issue.\n\nBioleach test 2 showed only $25 \\%$ iron dissolution, and $40 \\%$ arsenic dissolution. The use of pre-washes did not mitigate the problem of slow dissolution, and results were worse than in the previous test. It was hypothesized that the inhibitory substance in question was arsenic (III) or arsenic (V), but no conclusive evidence was presented.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.7 Rdi 2004\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.7.1 Batch Acid Pressure Oxidation Tests\n\nTwo series of tests were performed on the concentrate produced by RDI in 2003. One series was performed at $180^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, while the other used $200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Oxidation tests were conducted with $10 \\%$ solids, and used treatment times of 30,60 , and 90 minutes. The concentrate was pre-treated for 2 hours at pH 2 (with sulphuric acid) to remove carbonates prior to oxidation. Results are given in Table 13-14.Table 13-14 Results of Batch Acid POX Tests - Adapted from RDI 2004\n\n|  | Baseline | $180^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ POX |  |  | $200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ POX |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Oxidation Time (mins) | 0 | 30 | 60 | 90 | 30 | 60 | 90 |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ consumption <br> (pre-treatment, $\\mathrm{kg} / \\mathrm{t}$ ) |  | 145 | 136 | 138 | 138 | 121 | 125 |\n| \\% Sulphide oxidation |  | 98.8 | 99.4 | 100 | 95.1 | 100 | 100 |\n| \\% gold recovery <br> (48-hour) | 9.4 | 94.7 | 98.4 | 98.2 | 83.7 | 98.7 | 98.0 |\n| NaCN consumption (48- <br> hour, $\\mathrm{kg} / \\mathrm{t}$ ) | 1.33 | 1.18 | 1.41 | 1.03 | 0.79 | 1.24 | 1.19 |\n\nOxidation was near-complete or complete after just 30 minutes of pressure treatment. No acid was required, and moderate lime consumption was observed ( $5.7-7.8 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t}$ ) to increase pH after oxidation. Gold recoveries exceeded $98 \\%$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.7.2 Cyanidation - Bottle Roll Tests\n\nTo analyze the efficacy of the pressure oxidation tests described above, bottle roll tests were used on the untreated concentrate, as well as the oxidized residues. Tests were conducted at pH 11 , at $33 \\%$ solids, for 48 hours with $1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L} \\mathrm{NaCN}$. As seen above, untreated concentrates showed refractory behaviour, due to preg-robbing organic carbon, as well as the refractory nature the concentrate. Over $98 \\%$ extraction is seen from oxidized samples after high pressure tests. Low cyanide consumptions were observed across the board.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.8 Oxidor 2004\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.8.1 Bio-Oxidation Batch Amenability Tests (Bats)\n\nBio-oxidation tests were conducted in large 20 L stirred CSTR tanks, sparged with air. Bacterial adaptation was first performed on OXL-1014-R-13 culture. At first, no bacterial activity was observed; however, by day 10, unusually high activity was observed. This delay is thought to be the $2^{\\text {nd }}$ piece of evidence for an inhibitory substance at the onset of bacterial oxidation. During the adaptation, Redox potential fell from 825 mV to 590 mV SHE after introduction to the concentrate, and oxygen uptake was significantly lower than at the start of the tests. This may be because of oxidation of arsenic to its pentavalent form. Oxidation levels reached approximately $90 \\%$ after 22 days oxidation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.8.2 Cyanidation - Cil Tests\n\nAt various points during the trials described above, a slurry sample would be removed and gold extraction using cyanide would be performed.\n\nBaseline gold recovery results were extremely low: $8.2 \\%$ without oxidative pre-treatment. After 9 days of oxidation, gold recovery increased to $90 \\%$, showing a good response to sulphide oxidation. This result may be anomalous though, and this level was not attained again until 22 - 23 day's oxidation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.9 Pra 2007\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.9.1 Gravity Separation Tests\n\nThree gravity separation tests were conducted on the bulk composite sample from New Polaris. Conditions were as follows: 20\\% solids, 200G force gradient, 1.0 psi backwater pressure, using a Falcon SB40 concentrator. The resulting concentrate was panned to upgrade the gold contents. The tails and pan tails were combined to process via flotation. Results of these tests are shown in Table 13-15.\n\nTable 13-15 Gravity Concentrate Test Results\n\n| Test \\# | $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {80 }}$ Size $(\\mu \\mathrm{m})$ | Calc.

Average gold recovery was $4.8 \\%$ and the average grade was $231.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$. There was no discernable effect of particle size or head grade on recovery. The low recoveries confirmed the ore is not amenable to gravity concentration.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.9.2 Rougher Flotation Tests\n\nRougher flotation was conducted at $35 \\%$ solids by weight, unless specified. Tests were performed at natural pH . Where indicated, sodium sulphide $\\left(\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}\\right)$ was used during the grinding stage. PAX and MIBC were used as collector and frother, respectively. Copper sulphate $\\left(\\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}\\right)$ was sometimes used as an activator. Sulphur dioxide $\\left(\\mathrm{SO}_{2}\\right)$ was used for pyrite/arsenopyrite separation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.9.3 Gravity And Pan Tail Flotation\n\nGravity concentrator and pan tailings from the three tests described above were then assessed using flotation trials. Results of these tests are shown in Table 13-16.Table 13-16 Gravity Tails Bulk Flotation Test Results - Adapted from PRA 2007\n\n| Test <br> \\# | Test Conditions | Recovery (\\%) |  |  |  | Grade (g/t, \\%) |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | Au | As | Sb | Sr | Au | As | Sb | Sr |\n| GF1 | $\\begin{gathered} \\mathrm{pH} 8.9 \\\\ \\text { Rougher: } 50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{PAX}, 15 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{MIBC} \\\\ \\text { Scavenger: } 50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{PAX}, 19 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{MIBC} \\\\ 250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \\end{gathered}$ | 96.2 | 82.5 | 99.5 | 97.1 | 33.0 | 5.73 | 2.78 | 9.66 |\n| GF2 | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Grind: } 250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~S} \\\\ \\text { Rougher: } 50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{PAX}, 15 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{MIBC} \\\\ \\text { Scavenger (2 floats): } 50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{PAX}, 19 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\\\ \\text { MIBC, } 250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \\end{gathered}$ | 96.1 | 82.6 | 88.8 | 95.9 | 32.8 | 5.60 | 2.42 | 9.36 |\n| GF3 | Rougher: $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $19 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC <br> Scavenger (2 floats): $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $14 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ <br> MIBC, $250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ | 97.3 | 83.5 | 95.8 | 97.7 | 30.4 | 5.23 | 2.66 | 9.56 |\n\nNo discernable difference is seen between the test results, with the recovery results from test GF3 slightly higher, and the grade from test GF1 slightly higher. It seems that sulphidization (addition of $\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$ ) and particle size did not significantly affect gold recovery or concentrate gold grade.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.9.4 Arsenic And Antimony Depression Tests\n\nThe effect of copper sulphate addition was studied to suppress arsenic and antimony from the flotation concentrate. From the results shown in Table 13-17 less antimony and arsenic are seen in the F5 concentrate; however, the gold grade in the concentrate is also lowered. Gold recoveries are lower compared to the original flotation concentrate from Test F1. The conclusions given in the PRA report are that Stibnite and Arsenopyrite are two significant minerals in the deposit that bear gold, so depression of either of these minerals would result in significant gold losses.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.9.5 Pyrite And Arsenopyrite Separation Tests\n\nThe same tests also included floats that attempted to separate Pyrite and Arsenopyrite. Conditions for these tests included a regrind of rougher/scavenger concentrate for test F5, and $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ conditioning for test F4. Results indicate incomplete or partial separation is achieved. It appears that some gold is associated with all three minerals arsenopyrite, pyrite, and stibnite. Another result from these tests was the presence of gangue slimes that need to be considered in future testwork.Table 13-17 As/Sb Depression Flotation Test Results - Adapted from PRA 2007\n\n| Test <br> II | Test Conditions | Recovery (\\%) |  |  |  | Grade (g/t, \\%) |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | Au | As | Sb | $S_{T}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Au } \\\\ (\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}) \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { As } \\\\ (\\%) \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Sb } \\\\ (\\%) \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { S } \\\\ (\\%) \\end{gathered}$ |\n| GF1 | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { pH } 8.9 \\\\ \\text { Rougher: } 50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\text { PAX, } 15 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\text { MIBC } \\\\ \\text { Scavenger: } 50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\text { PAX, } 19 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\text { MIBC, } \\\\ 250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \\end{gathered}$ | 96.2 | 82.5 | 99.5 | 97.1 | 33.0 | 5.73 | 2.78 | 9.66 |\n| F4 | pH 9.3 <br> Rougher: $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $17 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC Scavenger (2 floats): $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX Cleaner: $8 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC <br> Pyrite/Arsenopyrite Sep: $50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ at pH 3 for 20 mins, $17 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC | 87.9 | 82.3 | 60.8 | 91.6 | 54.9 | 7.72 | 2.63 | 16.9 |\n| F5 | pH 9.1 <br> Rougher: $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $18 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC Scavenger (2 floats): $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX Cleaner: $25 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX 60 minute regrind ( pH 8.1 ) <br> Pyrite/Arsenopyrite Sep (4 floats): $50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ at pH 4 for 20 mins, 100 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX | 82.5 | 81.3 | 63.2 | 90.0 | 33.6 | 5.24 | 2.02 | 10.8 |\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.9.6 Cleaner Flotation Tests\n\nTests were conducted to investigate the effect of regrinding rougher concentrates on flotation grades. Three tests were done using cleaner flotation trials: tests F6 and F7 examined reground rougher concentrates using various reagents, while Test F8 tested rougher concentrate that was not reground but was pre-treated with $\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$ during the grinding stage. Results of these tests (found in Table 13-18 and Table 13-19) show that regrind of cleaner concentrates after two floats is unnecessary, since both gold grade and gold recovery is adversely affected. Test 8 shows good recovery and will likely be the basis of future tests.Table 13-18 Rougher Regrind Cleaner Flotation Test Results - Adapted from PRA 2007\n\n| Test <br> \\# | Test Conditions | Conc. or <br> Tails | Recovery (\\%) |  |  |  | Grade (g/t, \\%) |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |  | Au | As | Sb | $5 r$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Au } \\\\ (\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}) \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { As } \\\\ (\\%) \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Sb } \\\\ (\\%) \\end{gathered}$ | $5 r(\\%)$ |\n| F6 | pH 8.9 <br> Rougher: $\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{SiO}_{3}, 10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ <br> A3418, $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, 19 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC <br> Scavenger (x3): $15 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ <br> A3418, $75 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $9 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC <br> 20 minute regrind <br> Cleaner (x3): $650 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ $\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{SiO}_{3}, 10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ A3418, $51 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $9 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC | Cleaner <br> Tails | 45.3 | 37.7 | 51.2 | 66.7 | 63.2 | 8.27 | 5.99 | 29.7 |\n|  |  |  | 24.7 | 23.9 | 6.6 | 11.4 | 89.0 | 13.5 | 1.99 | 13.1 |\n|  |  | Ro/Scav Bulk | 91.6 | 91.6 | 71.0 | 93.2 | 25.1 | 3.95 | 1.63 | 8.14 |\n| F7 | pH 8.8 <br> Rougher: $\\mathrm{Na}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}, 10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ <br> A3418, $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, 19 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC <br> Scavenger (x3): $15 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ <br> A3418, $75 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $9 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC <br> 20 minute regrind <br> Cleaner x3): $650 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ $\\mathrm{Na}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}, 10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ A3418, $51 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, $9 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC | Cleaner <br> Tails | 47.1 | 37.6 | 55.1 | 65.1 | 65.2 | 7.08 | 6.52 | 28.9 |\n|  |  |  | 16.9 | 18.8 | 4.5 | 7.2 | 100.2 | 15.2 | 2.29 | 13.8 |\n|  |  | Ro/Scav Bulk | 90.0 | 88.5 | 73.3 | 93.2 | 25.4 | 3.40 | 1.77 | 8.45 |\n| F8 | Grind: $250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$ <br> Rougher: $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, 13 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC <br> Scavenger (x2): $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ <br> PAX, $13 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC, 250 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ <br> Cleaner (x2): $50 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ $\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{SiO}_{3}, 10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ PAX, 15 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ MIBC | Cleaner <br> Tails | 94.9 | 89.9 | 91.8 | 94.5 | 85.68 | 8.98 | 4.65 | 18.97 |\n|  |  |  | 1.8 | 4.4 | 4.0 | 2.1 | 2.20 | 0.59 | 0.27 | 0.57 |\n|  |  | Ro/Scav Bulk | 96.7 | 94.3 | 95.8 | 96.6 | 49.96 | 5.39 | 2.78 | 11.10 |Table 13-19 Test F8 Flotation Test Results -

Tests were conducted using 250 g of material ( $80 \\%$ passing $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ ) in a \" 9 K \" nutrient broth at $7.7 \\%$ solids at pH 1.5 (with sulphuric acid). The samples were then inoculated with a bacterial culture (applied at $10 \\%$ solids) and kept between $38-42^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ at a pH of 1.2 - 1.4. Bacterial activity was then monitored, and more ore was added once activity increased to desirable levels until $20 \\%$ solids was achieved in the conditioning reactor. Once the ferrous iron levels reduced to $0.1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ in solution, 300 mL of the slurry was extracted and transferred to a 3 L beaker with \"OK\" nutrient broth, and 20\\% solids was then achieved for the build-up phase.\n\nTests were stopped at different times, and slurry samples were extracted for analysis and cyanide gold leaching. Bio-leaching tests were conducted in 5 L stirred and aerated tanks, at $\\mathrm{pH} 1.2-1.4$, and $20 \\%$ solids at $40 \\pm 2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Dissolved oxygen levels were maintained above $2 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{L}$, and the slurry was stirred at460 rpm . Throughout the tests, ferrous and ferric iron, dissolved oxygen, pH , and Redox potential were monitored. Results were collated and compared to the gold recoveries obtained from cyanidation in Table 13-21.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.10.2 Cyanidation - Bottle Roll Tests\n\nBottle roll tests were conducted on the BIOX ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ residues that were extracted from the tank at different times throughout the bio-leaching phase.

However, after 22 days, bio-oxidation of the sulphides in the New Polaris concentrate was over $99 \\%$ complete, and subsequent gold extraction is over $95 \\%$. Cyanide consumption was quite high, at $12.25 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t}$ concentrate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.10.3 Biox ${ }^{\\Text {Tm }}$ Liquor Neutralization Tests\n\nOutotec conducted three neutralization tests on the liquor from BAT 1, to determine if the leach liquor from the BIOX ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ leaching process could be processed to remove harmful elements such as arsenic or ferric iron. TCLP (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) tests were undertaken on the solid products (residues) that were produced to determine their long-term stability in natural environments.\n\nThe first test used both lime ( $100 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ ) and limestone ( $200 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ ) slurries to neutralize the liquor. The second test used a lime slurry only. The final test replicated the conditions of Test 1, however it also included addition of ferric sulphate to ensure the iron to arsenic ratio in the liquor was maintained above 3.2. This proportion of ferric iron to arsenic is necessary to produce neutralization products that are more stable in the long term.Counter-current decantation (CCD) tests were performed, with flocculant being dosed four times in 15minute intervals at first, and then four 60-minute intervals. Settling times were maintained at 30 seconds, and the slurry was diluted to $7 \\%$ solids. The flocculants were made to $0.05 \\%$ strength solutions (from 100 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{L}$ stock solutions). Results of these tests are shown in Table 13-22.\n\nTable 13-22 Summary of Neutralization Tests - Adapted from Outotec 2018\n\n| Test \\# | Test Conditions | Neutralization Products |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | Solids (\\%) |  | Solution (mg/L) |  | TCLP (mg/L) |  |\n|  |  | Fe | As | Fe | As | Fe | As |\n| 1 | Lime + Limestone slurry | 15.7 | 5.8 | 0.1 | 0.3 | $<0.1$ | 10 |\n| 2 | Lime slurry | 14.8 | 6.1 | 0.4 | 0.4 | $<0.1$ | 3.9 |\n| 3 | Lime + Limestone + Ferric Sulphate | 16.1 | 5.0 | $<0.1$ | 0.4 | $<0.1$ | 2.3 |\n\nTest results show that after neutralization the liquor from BAT 1 passed EPA limits on aqueous iron and aqueous arsenic in solution, with all tests showing less than $5 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{L}$ iron and arsenic in solution. TCLP test results also showed that neutralization products exhibited long-term stability, except for Test 1, which allowed $10 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{L}$ of arsenic to leach from the solid residue. This was rectified in Test 3, with ferric sulphate added to the liquor before neutralization.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.10.4 Biox ${ }^{\\Text {Tm }}$ Slurry Settling Tests\n\nOutotec conducted slurry settling tests on the residue from BAT 3. The purpose of these tests was to select an appropriate flocculant to settle solids after BIOX ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ leaching, as well as determine an adequate dosage for the chosen flocculant. For these tests, 33 mL of the BIOX ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ slurry was dosed into a 100 mL cylinder, with 67 mL water and flocculant. Two inversions were then performed quickly, and a third inversion gently. The residue \"mud layer\" was marked over time. To choose the appropriate flocculant, the clarity of the liquor was monitored, and the settling rate in the cylinder was recorded. Results of the tests are as shown in Table 13-23.\n\nTable 13-23 Summary of Flocculant Screening Tests - Outotec 2018\n\n|  | Flocculant Tested (100 g/t) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Magna <br> 10 | Magna <br> 333 | Magna <br> 345 | Magna <br> 455 | Magna <br> 336 | Magna <br> 156 | Magna <br> 1011 | Magna <br> 405 |\n| Settling time (sec) | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 | 30 |\n| Displacement <br> $(\\mathrm{mm})$ | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 13 |\n| Settling Rate <br> $(\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{h})$ | 0.60 | 0.36 | 0.36 | 0.36 | 0.36 | 0.36 | 0.60 | 1.56 |\n| Overflow Clarity | Cloudy | Cloudy | Cloudy | Cloudy | Cloudy | Cloudy | Cloudy | Clear |\n\nFrom these results Magna 405 was chosen for the clear overflow stream it produced, as well as the high settling rates that were observed. To conduct the dosage optimization tests, 500 mL cylinders were used, and flocculant solutions were diluted to $25 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ from $250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$ stock solutions. Inversions were made asdescribed above, and settling rates were then recorded for each dosage. Results of these tests are taken from Outotec and presented in Figure 13-5.\n![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)\n(Source: MMTS, 2019)\nFigure 13-5 Slurry Settling Tests on BIOX ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ Products (Outotec RS (PTY) LTD, 2018)\nResults indicate that $150-250 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ flocculant dosage were enough to produce a settling rate of $2.3 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{h}$, and a thickener area flux of $8 \\mathrm{~m}^{2} \\mathrm{~h} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\nA second series of tests was undertaken to analyze flocculants for the settling of neutralized slurry.

The resource has been summarized at various cutoff grades with the base case Au grade cutoff of $4.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ highlighted. At each cutoff the total material within a potential confining mining shape is reported. Therefore, a separate mining shape has been created for each cutoff in the table.\n\nThe base case cutoff grade is $4 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ and the Mineral Resource has been confined by \"reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction\" shapes using the following assumptions:\n\n- Metal prices of US\\$1,750/oz Au and Forex of 0.75 \\$US:\\$CDN;\n- Payable metal of $99 \\% \\mathrm{Au}$;\n- Offsite costs (refining, transport and insurance) of US\\$7/oz;\n- Mining cost of CDN\\$82.78/t, Processing costs of CDN\\$105.00/t and G\\&A and site costs of CDN\\$66.00/t;\n- Metallurgical Au recovery of $90.5 \\%$;\n\nThe \"reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction\" confining shape also considers a minimum mining width of 2.0 m , and removes shapes considered too small and separated from the primary mining volumes. Previous underground mining has been accounted for by restricting the modelled veins away from the mined-out shapes.\n\nThe effective date of this Resource estimate is April 20 ${ }^{\\text {th }}, 2023$.Table 14-1\nUpdated Mineral Resource Estimate and Comparison to the 2019 Resource\n\n| Class | Cutoff <br> (Au gpt) | 2023 Resource |  |  | 2019 Resource |  |  | Difference as a Percent: <br> (2023-2019)/2019 |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | Tonnage <br> (ktonnes) | Au <br> (gpt) | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Au } \\\\ \\text { (koz) } \\end{gathered}$ | Tonnage <br> (ktonnes) | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Au } \\\\ \\text { (gpt) } \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Au } \\\\ \\text { (koz) } \\end{gathered}$ | Tonnage | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Au } \\\\ \\text { Grade } \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Au } \\\\ \\text { Metal } \\end{gathered}$ |\n| Indicated | 3 | 3,118 | 11.21 | 1,124 | 1,798 | 10.40 | 601 | $73 \\%$ | $8 \\%$ | $87 \\%$ |\n|  | 4 | 2,965 | 11.61 | 1,107 | 1,687 | 10.80 | 586 | $76 \\%$ | $8 \\%$ | $89 \\%$ |\n|  | 5 | 2,769 | 12.11 | 1,078 | 1,556 | 11.30 | 565 | $78 \\%$ | $7 \\%$ | $91 \\%$ |\n|  | 6 | 2,525 | 12.75 | 1,035 | 1,403 | 12.00 | 541 | $80 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $91 \\%$ |\n|  | 7 | 2,270 | 13.45 | 981 | 1,260 | 12.60 | 510 | $80 \\%$ | $7 \\%$ | $92 \\%$ |\n|  | 8 | 2,049 | 14.09 | 928 | 1,105 | 13.30 | 473 | $85 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $96 \\%$ |\n|  | 9 | 1,814 | 14.81 | 864 | 947 | 14.10 | 429 | $92 \\%$ | $5 \\%$ | $101 \\%$ |\n|  | 10 | 1,594 | 15.55 | 797 | 1,639 | 9.50 | 501 | $-3 \\%$ | $64 \\%$ | $59 \\%$ |\n| Inferred | 3 | 1,061 | 8.24 | 281 | 1,582 | 9.80 | 498 | $-33 \\%$ | $-16 \\%$ | $-44 \\%$ |\n|  | 4 | 926 | 8.93 | 266 | 1,483 | 10.20 | 486 | $-38 \\%$ | $-12 \\%$ | $-45 \\%$ |\n|  | 5 | 817 | 9.52 | 250 | 1,351 | 10.70 | 465 | $-40 \\%$ | $-11 \\%$ | $-46 \\%$ |\n|  | 6 | 706 | 10.16 | 231 | 1,223 | 11.20 | 440 | $-42 \\%$ | $-9 \\%$ | $-48 \\%$ |\n|  | 7 | 603 | 10.78 | 209 | 942 | 12.50 | 379 | $-36 \\%$ | $-14 \\%$ | $-45 \\%$ |\n|  | 8 | 491 | 11.52 | 182 | 753 | 13.80 | 334 | $-35 \\%$ | $-17 \\%$ | $-46 \\%$ |\n|  | 9 | 371 | 12.51 | 149 | 653 | 14.60 | 307 | $-43 \\%$ | $-14 \\%$ | $-51 \\%$ |\n|  | 10 | 291 | 13.33 | 125 | 0 | 0.00 | 0 |  |  |  |\n\nNotes for Mineral Resource Estimate:\n\n1. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n2. There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves.\n3. Resources are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards and were estimated using the 2019 CIM Best Practices Guidelines.\n4. The base case Mineral Resource has been confined by \"reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction\" shape using the following assumptions:\n\n- Metal prices of US\\$1,750/oz Au and Forex of 0.75 \\$US:\\$CDN;\n- Payable metal of $99 \\% \\mathrm{Au}$;\n- Offsite costs (refining, transport and insurance) of US\\$7/oz;\n- Mining cost of CDN\\$82.78/t ,\n- Processing costs of CDN\\$105.00/t and G\\&A and site costs of CDN\\$66.00/t.\n- Metallurgical Au recovery of $90.5 \\%$;\n\n5.

Numbers may not add due to rounding.\n\nThe QP for the resource estimate is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate. Factors that may affect the estimates include: metal price assumptions, changes in interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of mineralization zones, changes to kriging assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions, operating cost assumptions, confidence in the modifying factors, including assumptions that surface rights to allow mining infrastructure to be constructed will be forthcoming, delays or other issues in reaching agreements with local or regulatory authorities and stakeholders, and changes in land tenure requirements or in permitting requirement.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 14.3 Key Assumptions And Data Used In The Resource Estimate\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 14.4 Underground Workings And Topography\n\nUnderground workings and topography have been provided as solids and surfaces. They are the same as those used for the MMTS 2019 Resource Estimate with the exception that they have been converted to UTM coordinates (Underhill, 2021). The underground workings consist primarily of mined out stopes and stoping development levels used for historic long hole mining with side hill ramp access.\n\nThe topography and bottom of the overburden are both above any veins considered for the Resource Estimate, and the underground workings have been considered in the modelling procedure by clipping the modeled veins away from them. The underground workings and topography are shown in Error! Reference source not found..\n\nTo the knowledge of the QP for the Resource Estimate and based on the tour of the property and discussion with the site geologist, there are no additional underground workings that have not been included in the shapes provided in the areas of the 2023 resource estimate. The topography and underground workings are shown in (Source: MMTS, 2023)\nFigure 14-1.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.4.1 Database\n\nA summary of the total number of drillholes used for the Resource Estimate is found in Table 14-2 below.

The increase in number of veins is due to the additional drilling, additional fault modeling and tighter control on dilution resulting in veins being split. The modeled shapes generally target a $4.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ cutoff, while also honouring the known geological trends. Lower grade dilution is occasionally included to maintain continuity and to ensure the veins are a minimum of 2.0 meters in true thickness to align with the expected mining selectivity. The modeled shapes have also been clipped away from mined-out areas. An illustration of the veins is provided in Figure 14-1, with the \"C\" veins coloured and the \" $Y$ \" veins to north shown in grey, and the existing underground workings shown in black.\n![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg)\n(Source: MMTS, 2023)\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 14.6 Assay Statistics, Capping And Compositing\n\nMMTS has examined the sample assays in the veins using boxplots, histograms, and cumulative probability plots (CPPs). The gold grade distribution is shown below in Figure 14-3 as CPPs by Domain. The grade distribution for Au is mainly lognormal except at very high grades where outliers are evident and therefore capping of assays has been done. Table 14-3 summarizes the capping done on the assays prior to compositing. For clarity, also summarized in the table is the Outlier Restrictions which has been applied to the composites during interpolation. For composite grades above the Outlier value provided, and at distances greater than 4 m from the data, the value is essentially capped to the outlier.\n![img-23.jpeg](img-23.jpeg)\n(Source: MMTS, 2023)\nFigure 14-2 Gold Grade (gpt) by Domain - \"C\" Veins![img-24.jpeg](img-24.jpeg)\n(Source: MMTS, 2023)\nFigure 14-3 Gold Grade (gpt) by Domain - \"Y\" Veins\nTable 14-3 Capping of Assays and Outlier Restriction of Composites by Domain\n\n| Domain | Au Cap (gpt) | Au Outlier <br> (gpt) | Outlier <br> Distance |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 2 | 50 |  |  |\n| 3 | 50 |  |  |\n| 4 | 50 | 25 | 4 |\n| 5 | 50 | 25 | 4 |\n| 6 | 50 | 35 | 4 |\n| 8 | 25 | 20 | 4 |\n| 9 | 13 | 10 | 4 |\n| 10 | 20 | 15 | 4 |\n| 11 | 10 |  |  |\n| 15 | 12 |  |  |\n| 16 | 30 | 20 | 4 |\n| 19 | 20 |  |  |\n| 21 | 30 | 20 | 4 |\n| 22 | 50 | 35 | 4 |\n| 23 | 30 |  |  |\n| 24 | 30 |  |  |\n| 26 | 15 |  |  |\n\nAssay sample lengths have varied with the drill programs.

A total of 16 samples are from C Vein Domain 4. These 16 samples had an average specific gravity of 2.81 and this is the value used for all estimated blocks.

However, variograms were created on a global basis to aid in determination of Classification parameters.\n\nDomain matching for each of the 17 domains has been used, and a search ellipse with axis in the same orientation as the primary axes of each domain has been used to select samples for interpolation. Composite values have also been restricted at higher cutoffs to reduce the impact of high-grade samples.

Further validations have been done by visually comparing the modelled grades to the assay data, as presented below.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.12.1 Comparison Of Modelled Grades To De-Clustered Composites\n\nTo validate the block model, a Nearest Neighbor model has been created (NN) to compare the declustered composite data to the interpolated grades. The following Table 14-10 compares the relative metal content across grade-bins of Indicated Resources. Decreasing relative metal content as the grade increases confirms that interpolated grades are conservative compared to de-clustered composite values.\n\nAlthough Domains 8 and 9 do not have a good comparison between modelled and NN model grades, they are very small domains that contributes little to the overall Resource. It is also established that Domain 9 contains assays at the peripheries of the solids, but still within the domains that are below cutoff, contributing to the values of lower de-clustered composite (NN) grades.Table 14-10 Block Model and Declustered Composite Comparison, Au, Indicated Resources\n\n| Domain | ID2 / NN Contained Metal, Indicated Blocks only |  |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Cuf off, g/t |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 1 | 4 | 6 | 9 | 15 | \\% Total at 4 <br> g/t Cut Off |\n| 2 | $92 \\%$ | $92 \\%$ | $92 \\%$ | $90 \\%$ | $68 \\%$ | $25.9 \\%$ |\n| 3 | $96 \\%$ | $98 \\%$ | $98 \\%$ | $92 \\%$ | $70 \\%$ | $10.5 \\%$ |\n| 4 | $96 \\%$ | $96 \\%$ | $98 \\%$ | $96 \\%$ | $77 \\%$ | $8.5 \\%$ |\n| 5 | $96 \\%$ | $97 \\%$ | $94 \\%$ | $90 \\%$ | $85 \\%$ | $13.3 \\%$ |\n| 6 | $97 \\%$ | $96 \\%$ | $93 \\%$ | $96 \\%$ | $90 \\%$ | $17.6 \\%$ |\n| 8 | $95 \\%$ | $95 \\%$ | $93 \\%$ | $114 \\%$ | $106 \\%$ | $1.9 \\%$ |\n| 9 | $131 \\%$ | $134 \\%$ | $113 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $0.2 \\%$ |\n| 10 | $96 \\%$ | $95 \\%$ | $84 \\%$ | $97 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $3.7 \\%$ |\n| 11 | $91 \\%$ | $87 \\%$ | $54 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $1.2 \\%$ |\n| 15 | $76 \\%$ | $68 \\%$ | $58 \\%$ | $41 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $0.4 \\%$ |\n| 16 | $90 \\%$ | $91 \\%$ | $91 \\%$ | $74 \\%$ | $59 \\%$ | $4.0 \\%$ |\n| 19 | $102 \\%$ | $102 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ | $99 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $1.4 \\%$ |\n| 21 | $84 \\%$ | $83 \\%$ | $82 \\%$ | $82 \\%$ | $45 \\%$ | $5.1 \\%$ |\n| 22 | $95 \\%$ | $95 \\%$ | $95 \\%$ | $99 \\%$ | $69 \\%$ | $4.5 \\%$ |\n| 23 | $78 \\%$ | $77 \\%$ | $70 \\%$ | $38 \\%$ | $6 \\%$ | $0.4 \\%$ |\n| 24 | $72 \\%$ | $69 \\%$ | $86 \\%$ | $39 \\%$ | $29 \\%$ | $0.3 \\%$ |\n| 26 | $90 \\%$ | $86 \\%$ | $91 \\%$ | $71 \\%$ | $0 \\%$ | $1.1 \\%$ |\n| All Domains | $94 \\%$ | $94 \\%$ | $93 \\%$ | $91 \\%$ | $72 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 14.13 Visual Validation\n\nThe modelled Au grades have been compared to the assay grades in section and plan to ensure the model matches the data.

    "text": "The Project is expected to yield gold doré as its final product, which is expected to be sold on the spot market through marketing experts retained by Canagold. Gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world; its market price at any time is easily and reliably ascertained. The large number of available gold purchasers, both domestically and internationally, allow for gold production to be sold on a regular and predictable basis, and on a competitive basis with respect to the spot price.\n\nA long-term gold price of US\\$1,750/oz is considered by the QP as reasonable with respect to the prevailing market and has been used in the PEA. The QP expects that terms and conditions for gold sales will be typical of similar contracts in the industry for the sale of doré."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 20.1 Environmental\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.1.1 Aquatic/Terrestrial\n\nSeveral environmental baseline studies have been initiated and either completed or suspended in 1997, 2007 and again in 2015, however supplementary work was started in 2019 to facilitate a formal environmental assessment with the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office (BCEAO) to review and refresh data. These include but are not limited to:\n\n- Water quality and quantity (surface and ground)\n- Risk Assessment Items for Terrestrial and Aquatic Resources (vegetation, sediment, invertebrates, periphyton, soils etc.)\n- Air Quality/Meteorology/Climate\n- Wildlife\n\nFish and fish habitat have been characterized in the project area several times beginning in 1997. Spawning and rearing habitat that supports both sea-run and freshwater salmonid species include chinook, coho, pink, and sockeye salmon. The mainstem Tulsequah River has been shown to afford poor fisheries values due to low water temperatures and lack of in-stream cover, typical of glacial runoff systems. Based on observations, Whitewater Creek in the project area contains fish rearing and spawning habitat superior to the Tulsequah River and therefore remains critical habitat necessary for sustaining populations (GLL 1997). Future development will have to carefully consider the streams and the riparian habitat which encompasses them.\n\nThe project area contains populations of large ungulates and predators. Past studies have identified local species present, and additional studies have been performed to update previous information.\n\nCritical components of impact mitigation include Management Plans for land, water, air, wildlife, fisheries and groundwater. The project will be designed to avoid and minimize environmental impacts during the construction and operating phases of the mine and to minimize any long-term environmental impacts. Ongoing works continue to incorporate and advance the results of all previously completed aquatic, hydrogeology and terrestrial work on site.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.1.2 Geochemistry\n\nCanagold retained URS Canada Inc. to assess the acid rock drainage and metal leaching potential of major rock units anticipated to be exposed. Studies were completed by static testing conducted on 27 \"fresh\" rock drill core samples, collected from sections of the C vein, and flotation testing was conducted on 5 test tailings samples. A criterion of 2.0 weight $\\%$ sulphide Sulphur has been developed to distinguish between non-acid generating and potentially acid generating materials. For waste rock, sampling indicated, generally, that the rock is non-acid generated in nature, due to high carbonate content. It should be noted there were some localized areas that showed some potential for acid generation (URS Canada, 2007b). For tailings, based on static testing of 5 samples, tailings are not expected to be acid generating. This was indicated by sulphide Sulphur content being typically less than $0.3 \\%$ and the corresponding carbonate content being greater than $3.5 \\%$.Total metals analysis and leachate extraction test results for hanging wall rock, vein rock and footwall rock indicate a high potential for leaching of arsenic and antimony. Results found in tailings had similarly elevated concentrations. Further studies, although only in draft form at the time of writing, showed these occurred in low concentrations to the point where it was speculated these lithologies are considered to have low metal leaching potential. More studies, including kinetic testing (humidity cell) are being done to further characterize waste rock, tailings and effluent leaching and ARD potential (URS 2007).\n\nTailings are planned to be disposed of in both underground and surface facilities. Tailings on surface will be thickened and disposed of in a drystack facility and will not be designed in a conventional fashion to store water. Underground disposal will be directed to old workings to minimize the total surface disturbance footprint.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.1.3 Recovery\n\nThe processing of ore will include a typical mill feed system closed off to the environment. It is also important to note that the introduction of bio-leach of concentrates on-site to produce doré bars, is proposed. The use of cyanide, as proposed, to leach metals from rock is a process generally acceptable in BC provided the facility is completely closed off from the environment and the facility meets rigorous environmental standards and practices including transport, handling, storage, and deconstruction of the chemical.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.1.4 Reclamation/Closure\n\nThe reclamation of the mine site, its associated infrastructure and any post mining effluent treatment is a requirement of the Mines Act, and accordingly will require a detailed Plan and Reclamation Bond. The reclamation plan and bonding process will seek regulatory, and First Nations input and approval prior to the start of mining and processing operations.\n\nReclamation costing will be developed as part of the mine planning and feasibility study stages. At this time, no assessment as to closure amounts has been completed.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.2 Regulatory Framework\n\nThe New Polaris Project will be subject to Provincial and Federal approvals to proceed to construction and operations phases. A federal environmental assessment is not expected as the production threshold does not meet the 5,000 tpd threshold. Additional authorizations and input may also be required from United States authorities as the Project area drains into US waters (Transboundary Water).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.2.1 Provincial Processes\n\nWhen a major project is proposed in British Columbia, it must undergo an environmental assessment. In B.C. environmental assessments are managed by the Environmental Assessment Office (EAO), a neutral regulatory agency within the provincial government.\n\nThe BCEAO works with First Nations, government agencies and the public to ensure major projects are developed in a sustainable manner. The EA process examines major projects for potentially adverse environmental, economic, social, health and heritage effects that may occur during the lifecycle of these projects.Public participation in the environmental assessment process helps to ensure that community values and public goals for community development are considered in project planning and decision-making, and is an important component of permitting.\n\nMore information can be found on the BC government website:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/environmentalassessments\n\nThe process of pre-application, application, review, and approval may take up to 3 years or more; depending upon technical complexity, consultation requirements, and the significance of potential impacts.\n\nOnce issued, the EA certificate remains in effect for the life of the project, unless suspended or cancelled by the Minister of Environment.\n\nThe estimated time to secure all necessary Provincial approvals for The Project to proceed is 1-3 years from an acceptable Project Description, however complexity of issues and other issues can delay approval significantly, depending upon the complexity of issues and the acceptability of recommended mitigation of proposed impacts.\n\nA significant aspect of permit application for The Project will include the need for an acceptable Mine and Reclamation Plan, an Environmental Management System, a Sediment Control and Water and Waste Management Plan, and a Mine Closure Plan. Other specific Environmental Plans may include Fish Habitat Mitigation, Wildlife Habitat Mitigation, Special Waste Management, and others. Cost and time for major Environmental Plans are not included, as the scope of their requirements has not been fully developed.\n\nSome of the Provincial Acts and Regulations that may apply to The Project include the;\n\n- Environmental Assessment Act\n- Drinking Water Protection Act\n- Energy Efficiency Act\n- Environmental Management Act (including wastes and contaminated sites authorizations)\n- Fish Protection Act\n- Forest and Range Practices Act\n- Forest Practices Code of BC Act\n- Geothermal Resources Act\n- Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in BC\n- Heritage Conservation Act\n- Archaeological permitting and registries\n- Hydro and Power Authority Act\n- Land Act\n- Crown Land tenure applications- Local Government Act\n- Mineral Tenure Act\n- Mines Act (including Mining and Reclamation Permits and Bonding)\n- Transport of Dangerous Goods Act\n- Transportation Act\n- Water Act\n- Water rights\n- Water license application\n- Water Protection Act\n- Water Utility Act\n- Water utilities\n- Wildlife Act\n- Wildlife permits and commercial licenses\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.2.2 Federal Processes\n\nFederal environmental assessments must be conducted prior to a project proceeding if: a federal authority is the proponent of the project, federal money is involved, the project involves land in which a federal authority has an interest, or some aspect of the project requires federal approval or authorization.\n\nFederal assessments will likely focus on areas of particular interest to the federal authorities such as species at risk, effects of accidents and malfunctions, effects of the environment on the project, effects of the project on the capacity of renewable resources, cumulative effects, and First Nations engagement and consultation.\n\nFederal permits and approvals that still may be required are included in the following;\n\n- Canadian Environmental Protection Act\n- Transboundary Waters Protection Act\n- Fisheries Act\n- Migratory Birds Convention Act\n- Navigable Waters Protection Act\n- Species at Risk Act\n- Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act\n- Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency Registry\n- Canadian Transportation Agency\n- Environment Canada, including the Canadian Wildlife Service and Species at Risk requirements\n- Indian and Northern Affairs Canada\n- Fisheries and Oceans Canada Species at Risk, including Species at Risk requirements\n- Health Canada requirements\n- Natural Resources Canada- Transport Canada requirements\n- Explosives Act\n\nIt is not unreasonable to expect approvals will be received for the New Polaris Project to be conditional upon acceptance of respective Management Plans and commitments.\n\n# Land Use Planning \n\nThe New Polaris Project lies within the area of the Atlin/Taku Land Use Plan (2011). The plan allows for Resource Development, including mining, contingent upon meeting specific requirements of Management Plans for specifies issues, including those of particular interest to the local First Nations. There are 7 objectives set in the affected land use plan concerning mineral extraction/exploration with respect to engaging with stakeholders. Above all, but not to reduce significance from others, Objective \\#2 states that a proponent must ensure mineral exploration and development are undertaken in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. It is important to respectfully engage with local First Nations and community stake holders to establish a positive relationship and to understand concerns with the intention to incorporate them into design, operations, and closure.\n\n## First Nations\n\nThe New Polaris Project is situated on the asserted Traditional Territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation, the only First Nation recognized as having status in this area to date.\n\nCanagold has developed a good working relationship with the TRTFN and maintains a collaborative agreement to formalize their commitment for open, honest communications that were already ongoing between Canagold and TRTFN. TRTFN has a Mining Policy that relates to the development of projects within their traditional territory. A Management Plan as required in the Atlin/Taku Land Use Plan provides Implementation Direction for the Resource Management Zone that contains the New Polaris Project site.\n\nThe draft Gap Analysis developed by Gartner Lee in 2007 referenced a Conservation Area Design and TRTFN Vision and Management Direction report, which provides some general insight into current and past traditional use and harvesting practices.\n\nIn addition, other recently proposed projects in the area, prepared for BCEAO, provide detailed accounts of current land use, social and economic relations, valued components and an account of traditional use and wage based economic activity. A documented oral history is also available that identifies the Tulsequah River as a place where harvesting activity took place.\n\nTo meet regulatory requirements, it will be necessary to prepare a detailed Traditional Knowledge Study providing more information on current and historical traditional use specific to the New Polaris Project area.\n\nArcheological and Heritage Resources of the Project area have been updated as part of the baseline studies to support the BC Environmental Assessment. A Chance Find Procedure will need to be developed to ensure the identification and protection of additional areas.Canagold is required to develop and maintain a Consultation and Engagement Plan with TRTFN, provide timelines and details of any engagement, and document any agreements reached between them with respect to the New Polaris Project.\n\n# Community/Social \n\nThe communities of Atlin, Five Mile Point and Unnamed No. 10 have been recognized as being within the area potentially affected by the New Polaris Project, although the very limited data available from Statistics Canada indicate that it will be important to collect current information.\nCommunity and Social Consultation and Engagement requires a Plan and Implementation Strategy to be developed and maintained with the input of identified communities and other potentially affected stakeholders. This engagement has started and will be ongoing.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.3 Socio-Economic\n\nThe mine is in an area that has low usage for mining, exploration, hunting, fishing, trapping, and logging activities. The New Polaris site was previously mined between 1938 and 1956 with remnants of the old activities still being present at the site.\n\nThe project is located within the land claim and traditional territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation (TRTFN).\n\nIt is expected that the project will enhance employment opportunities for the people of TRTFN during the construction, operation, and closure of the Project. Operational training as well as trades training opportunities will also be made available for the members of the TRTFN on a preferential basis. Several other benefits will accrue to Atlin through funding of social events, scholarships for higher education, and community enhancement programs.\n\nDuring the exploration phase of the project a high percentage of employees have been from Atlin and the surrounding area. It is the intention of Canagold to continue to operate in a fashion that ensures the local community, and its citizens, continue to benefit from the construction and operation of the mine.\n\nThe sourcing of qualified and experienced underground miners, process personnel, and tradesmen is a concern, particularly with the current labour shortages in Western Canada. Canagold will continue to source appropriate personnel as the project advances. A contract mining company will also be pursued.\n\nSince access to the site for major supplies will use shallow barges up the Taku River it is likely that many supplies may be purchased in Juneau. Supplies not available in Juneau will be purchased in Southern BC, Canada or the United States and shipped to site through Seattle and Juneau. Barging will be done using independent contractors who have the required equipment and have the necessary experience with this type of service. The major items needed for the operation will be diesel fuel, ground support supplies, mill reagents \\& supplies, explosives, and a variety of components for equipment maintenance.\n\nThe current plan is based on a fly-in fly-out rotation and an onsite camp. Air transportation will be used for transporting employees and perishable items or small items needed to sustain the operation. As other projects in the area are developed the opportunity may arise to use access and infrastructure developed for those other projects.Continued work in negotiations with First Nations, labour force planning, and the impact on local infrastructure is recommended.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to expect support from local communities contingent upon the Project proponents developing acceptable plans for mitigation and final reclamation of project impacts."

    "text": "An updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the New Polaris Project has been completed. It is the opinion of the QP's that the resource is of sufficient quality to proceed with engineering studies and further drilling to upgrade the Classification of additional resources and potentially extend the mineralization.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.1 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights, Royalties And Agreements\n\n- The mineral tenure held is valid and sufficient to support the Mineral Resources.\n- Surface rights will be required from the Crown before operations.\n- Royalties are payable to third parties.\n- There are no other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the property that have not been discussed in this report.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.2 Geology, Mineralization, Exploration\n\n- The deposit is an example of mesothermal lode-gold mineralization.\n- Knowledge of the deposit settings, lithologies, mineralization style and setting, and structural and alteration controls on mineralization is sufficient to support the Mineral Resource estimation.\n- The quantity and quality of the lithological, collar and downhole survey data collected in the drill programs are sufficient to support Mineral Resource estimation.\n- Canagold has been drilling on the Property since 1988. To date total drilling totals about 145 km in approximately 1100 drillholes.\n- The sample security, sample preparation and analytical procedures during the exploration programs by Canagold followed accepted industry practice appropriate for the stage of mineral exploration undertaken.\n- Data verification has been conducted by Canagold, and no material issues have been identified by those programs.\n- Data collected have been sufficiently verified for post 1988 drilling that these drillholes can support Mineral Resource estimation and can be used for mine planning purposes.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.3 Mineral Resource\n\n- The base case Mineral Resource contains an Indicated resource of 2.97 Mt of $11.61 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ for 1.1 Moz of Au and an Inferred resource of 0.93 Mt of $8.93 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ for an additional 0.27 Moz of Au.\n- The base case Mineral Resource is confined by an underground shape that targets material above a $4.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ cutoff grade which shows suitable economics for further studies.\n- The Mineral Resource has been updated for the \"C\" and \"Y\" veins of the New Polaris deposit.\n- In total, 234 core drillholes from 1988 to 2022 inclusive have been used to determine the Resource estimate. A limited amount of historical data has been used and was validated.\n- The updated resource accounts for \"reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction\" by removing any portions of the mineralization that have a true thickness of less than two metres, and by removing discontinuous mineralization that is not of sufficient volume to have potential for underground mining at the current state of knowledge of the deposit.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.4 Metallurgy And Process\n\n- The completion of a several metallurgical test work campaigns has developed a process flowsheet for the economic extraction of gold from New Polaris ore.\n- Gold is associated with arsenopyrite and is refractory.\n- An onsite process plant is expected to consist of crushing, grinding and flotation to produce a flotation concentrate.\n- The flotation concentrate will be treated using bio-oxidation and a CIL plant, followed by carbon stripping, electrowinning, and refining steps to produce doré gold bars.\n- An overall gold recovery of $90.5 \\%$ is projected at this point in the project analyses.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.5 Environmental, Permitting And Social Impact\n\n- It is not unreasonable to expect the New Polaris Project will be approved by regulators, with the inclusion of acceptable Management and Mitigation Plans for potential impacts.\n- It is also not unreasonable that the Project will enjoy community support with the inclusion of acceptable Management plans and commitments from the Proponent."
