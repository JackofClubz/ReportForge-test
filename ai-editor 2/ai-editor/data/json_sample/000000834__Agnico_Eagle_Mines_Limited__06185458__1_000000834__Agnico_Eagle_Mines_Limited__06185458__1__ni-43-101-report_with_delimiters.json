Forward-looking statements reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events or Agnico Eagle Mines Limited's (Agnico Eagle or the Company) future performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"continues\", \"forecasts\", \"projects\", \"predicts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"targets\", or \"believes\", or variations of, or the negatives of, such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"should\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved.\n\nForward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any of its future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, assumptions and parameters underlying the life of mine update not being realized, a decrease in the future gold price, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, discrepancies related to the impact of various capital projects and the anticipated benefits therein, required capital investments; estimates of net present value and internal rate of returns; the accuracy of Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates, production estimates and capital and operating cost estimates and the assumptions on which such estimates are based; market competition; ongoing relations with employees and impacted communities changes in costs (including labour, supplies, fuel and equipment), changes to tax rates, environmental compliance and changes in environmental legislation and regulation, exchange rate fluctuations, general economic conditions and other risks involved in the gold exploration and development industry, as well as those risk factors discussed in the Technical Report. Such forward-looking statements are also based on a number of assumptions which may prove to be incorrect, including, but not limited to, assumptions about the following: the availability of financing for exploration and development activities; operating and capital costs; the Company's ability to attract and retain skilled staff; sensitivity to metal prices and other sensitivities; the supply and demand for, and the level and volatility of the price of gold; the supply and availability of consumables and services; the exchange rates of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar; energy and fuel costs; the accuracy of Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates and the assumptions on which the Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates are based; market competition; ongoing relations with employees and impacted communities and general business and economic conditions. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof, or such other date or dates specified in such statements.All forward-looking statements in this Technical Report are necessarily based on opinions and estimates made as of the date such statements are made and are subject to important risk factors and uncertainties, many of which cannot be controlled or predicted. Agnico Eagle and the Qualified Persons who authored the Technical Report undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information or future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\n\n# Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures \n\nThis Technical Report includes certain non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") financial performance measures which the Company believes that, together with measures determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), provide readers with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Examples of such non-GAAP performance measures used in this technical report include \"total cash costs per ounce\", \"free cash flow\", \"sustaining capital expenditures\", \"development capital expenditures\", and \"minesite costs per tonne\". These non-GAAP financial performance measures are not standardized measures under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other gold mining companies Some of these non-GAAP measures may also be forward looking information. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\nFor a discussion of the composition and usefulness of certain of these non-GAAP financial performance measures and a reconciliation of these historical measures to the most equivalent financial performance measure prepared under IFRS, see the Company's Management Discussion \\& Analysis for the periods ended 31 December, 2023 and 31 March, 2024 under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\".# Table of Contents \n\n1.0 SUMMARY ..... $1-1$\n1.1 Introduction ..... $1-1$\n1.2 Terms of Reference ..... $1-1$\n1.3 Property Description and Location .....

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 1.1 Introduction\n\nMs. Dyane Duquette, P.Geo., Mr. Andre Leite, P.Eng., and Ms. Julie Bélanger, P.Eng., prepared a NI 43-101 Technical Report (the Report) on the Detour Lake Operations (also referred to as the Detour Lake Mine, or the Project) for Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (Agnico Eagle). The Detour Lake Operations are located in northeastern Ontario.\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine consists of the operating Detour Lake Pit, and a planned open pit operation at North Pit. Mineral Resources are estimated for the Detour Lake deposit and Zone 58N areas. Mineral Reserves are estimated for the Detour Lake Pit and North Pit areas.\n\nThe Report includes the results of a preliminary economic assessment (2024 PEA) on a conceptual underground mining operation below the Detour Lake Pit, and an optimization plan for the process plant to increase the throughput rate to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.2 Terms Of Reference\n\nUnits used in the report are metric units unless otherwise noted. Monetary units are in Canadian dollars (C\\$) unless otherwise stated. All ounce units refer to troy ounces. The Report uses Canadian English. Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are reported in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014; the 2014 CIM Definition Standards). Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves were estimated using the 2019 CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, Best Practice Guidelines. Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of those Mineral Resources converted to Mineral Reserves.\n\nThe Project is wholly-owned by Agnico Eagle.\nThe Detour Lake deposit and open pit can also be referred to as the Detour Main deposit and open pit. The Detour Lake Pit refers to the consolidated area that encompasses the previously distinct Detour Lake Main Pit and West Detour areas. The Detour Lake deposit is further subdivided into a number of zones, including the Upper West, Lower Saddle, Upper Saddle and Old Workings zones.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.3 Property Description And Location\n\nThe Project is situated approximately 300 km northeast of Timmins and 185 km by road northeast of Cochrane. From the town of Cochrane (population of approximately 5,000 residents), the Project is easily accessible by the Detour Lake Mine road, the northern extension of Highway 652. The first 151 km on Highway 652 is paved surface, followed by 34 km of well-maintained chip-seal road to the mine site. Road access is available year-round. An airstrip built in 2021 provides access to site by air. The closest major airport to the site is at Timmins, Ontario, approximately 61 km to the southeast.\n\nThe climate in the Project area is characterized by cold winters and mild summers. The average total annual precipitation is estimated at 862 mm with approximately 30\\% falling as snow, and the greatest precipitation contribution occurring as rain during June through October. The predominant wind direction is from the west. Mining and exploration activities are conducted year-round.\n\nSite topography is subdued with maximum local relief of approximately 30 m . The elevation ranges from approximately 260-288 metres above sea level. Areas of higher relief are sparsely wooded with jack pine, black and white spruce, balsam fir, trembling aspen, and white birch. Areas that are slightly lower in relief are poorly drained and characterized by muskeg. There is very little bedrock outcrop and much of the Project area is overlain by thick accumulations of glacial material that includes till and glaciofluvial material (poorly sorted sand with lenses of gravel).\n\nNumerous small streams linking elliptical lakes and ponds, generally oriented parallel to the pattern of glacial fluting. Many small and shallow lakes are found within the Project area, the largest being Sunday Lake.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.4 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights And Royalties\n\nEffective February 8, 2022, Agnico Eagle acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Kirkland Lake Gold, resulting in Kirkland Lake Gold becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Agnico Eagle. Effective January 1, 2024, Agnico Eagle and Kirkland Lake Gold amalgamated, with the resulting entity continuing under the name Agnico Eagle. Agnico Eagle has a 100\\% interest in the Project.\n\nThe $646 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}$ Project area forms one contiguous group of mining patents, mining leases and cell mining claims in the District of Cochrane, Ontario, with a small group of cell claims in Massicotte Township, Québec. The mineral tenure in Ontario consists of\n\n- 2,213 cell mining claims: 39,677 ha;\n- 45 lease documents: 24,613 ha;\n- 10 patent documents: 594 ha.\n\nThere are an additional 20 claims covering 549 ha in Quebec.\nAgnico Eagle has 30 leases and 10 patents totaling 18,574.442 ha of surface rights on the Detour Lake Project. The surface rights are sufficient for all surface infrastructure and mine operation.\n\nAgnico Eagle does not exclusively hold water rights in the region. As part of the ongoing environmental compliance Agnico Eagle is required to capture all site runoff from stockpiles and the open pits. Water taking from groundwater and freshwater sources is regulated by the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks via Permits to Take Water.The Detour Lake Mine has a number of active Permits to Take Water, which are renewed at the required regulatory frequency in order to support activities over the life-of-mine (LOM). Since this water is required to be captured it puts the site water balance in a surplus over the LOM, providing sufficient water to be used for processing in the mill, with the excess being discharged to the environment under the permitted discharge conditions for the operations.\n\nExploration activities require water-taking permits to be obtained to provide the necessary water for exploration drilling activities. To the Report effective date, all such permits had been granted as required.\n\nCertain of the claims are subject to a 2\\% royalty payable to Franco-Nevada Corporation. This royalty is included in the cash flow analysis. Prism Resources Inc. is entitled to a 7.5\\% net profit interest on the Zone 58N deposit. Other claims are subject to royalties to thirdparties but these claims do not fall within the area of the estimated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. Agnico Eagle has certain payments to First Nations groups in the area of the estimated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; these payments are included in the economic analysis. The Detour Lake Operations are not subject to any other back-in rights payments, agreements or encumbrances.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.5 Geology And Mineralization\n\nThe Detour Lake and Zone 58N deposits are considered to be examples of orogenic greenstone-hosted hydrothermal lode gold deposits.\n\nThe Project is located within the northwestern portion of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt that consists of east-west-trending synclines of felsic to ultramafic volcanic rocks. Intervening domes are cored by syn-volcanic tonalite and gabbro-diorite rocks and alternate with east-west-trending bands of late tectonic turbiditic and conglomeratic sedimentary rocks. Most of the volcanic and sedimentary strata dip vertically and are commonly bound by abrupt, east-west-trending faults with varied dips.\n\nIn the Project area, the greenstone-granite architecture is partially aligned and disrupted along a linear, east-west-trending belt that defines the position of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone. Supracrustal rocks within the Project area consist of a thick sequence of mafic to ultramafic lithologies, which are predominantly volcanic in origin, and are part of the Deloro assemblage. They occur within regional synclinal-anticlinal fold structures traced for over 30 km across the Project and are in structural contact to the south with the younger sediments of the Caopatina assemblage. These rocks are bounded to the north and west by the Opatica basement gneissic rocks. To the east and south, the Deloro assemblage is intruded by several large, weakly foliated granodioritic to tonalitic intrusions which are intersected by numerous local felsic to mafic dykes, sills, and younger regional Proterozoic diabase dykes.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.5.1 Detour Lake Deposit\n\nThere are two recognized episodes of gold mineralization at the Detour Lake deposit.The first episode consists of a wide and generally auriferous sulphide-poor quartz vein stockwork formed in the hanging wall of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone. The sulphidepoor quartz vein stockworks observed in the hanging wall have sub-vertical north or south dips and are parallel to a series of east-west-trending high strain zones. These veins form a weak stockwork and are boudinaged and/or folded.\n\nThe second episode is a stage of gold mineralization overprinting the early auriferous stockwork, principally in the hanging wall of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, with a higher sulphide content. The sulphide-rich gold mineralization predominantly fills structural sites in deformed quartz veins, fractures and veins crosscutting the foliation fabric but also in pillow breccias and selvages. The distribution of sulphide-rich mineralization is strongly controlled by the geometry of kinematic orientation (i.e., pyrite and pyrrhotite concentrations have a shallow westerly plunge similar to the plunge of the main flexure zone in the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, at an angle of about $40^{\\circ}$ (in the area of the former Campbell pit), shallowing to approximately $10^{\\circ}$ further to the west).\n\nThe major structural feature is the 30 km -long Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, an east-west-trending, steeply north-dipping deformation corridor. A second major regional eastwest trending structure, the Massicotte Deformation Zone, is recognized several kilometres to the south of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone and extends for over 30 km in strike length. It marks the southern contact between the Caopatina assemblage sedimentary rocks and the underlying Deloro assemblage volcanic rocks. The third major structure is the Lower Detour Deformation Zone, a 30 km long, east-west-trending, and steeply southdipping one that separates Caopatina assemblage sedimentary rocks and the underlying Deloro assemblage volcanic rocks. The 58 North Zone (58N) occurs immediately south of the Lower Detour Deformation Zone.\n\nThe youngest structures are a series of $120-145^{\\circ}$ trending faults, which are locally intruded by Proterozoic-age diabase dykes. Two east-trending synform-antiform pairs are developed in the volcanic assemblage, the North Walter Lake Synform and the Airstrip Antiform. These folds are tight, upright, slightly overturned, and south-facing. A later fold set consists of broad open folds that have axial traces striking at approximately $145^{\\circ}$ and plunging $10-35^{\\circ}$ to the northwest. The inter-limb distances of these folds are approximately $8-12 \\mathrm{~km}$.\n\nMineralization within the Detour Lake deposit is hosted within a broad corridor. Mineralization extends from approximately 584,000 E to 593,000 E, 5,540,500 N to $5,542,000 \\mathrm{~N}$ and $5,500 \\mathrm{~m}$ elevation to $6,300 \\mathrm{~m}$ elevation. This corresponds to a strike extent of 9.0 km , a width of 1.5 km , and an approximate elevation range of $1,000 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.5.2 Zone 58 N Deposit\n\nThe Zone 58N deposit has an east-west strike length of 450 m , extends from surface to a depth of 800 m , and the mineralized system remains open at depth. Gold mineralization in Zone 58 N is within the southern portion of a feldspar porphyry intrusion, and hosted by a swarm of plagioclase-phyric tonalitic dykes that intrude mafic rocks of the Deloro assemblage. Gold is found within and at the margins of quartz $\\pm$ tourmaline $\\pm$ carbonatestockwork-type veins that infill areas of brittle deformation. Visible gold occurs in nearly every drill hole that intersects mineralization and is also present as micro-inclusions within pyrite grains, or intergrown with bismuth-tellurides.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.5.3 Exploration Potential\n\nExploration potential remains in the area where Mineral Resources are estimated. The Detour Lake deposit remains open at depth and along strike.\nRegionally, geophysical surveys and exploration drill holes have identified a number of gold showings and structural trends that warrant additional exploration.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.6 History\n\nCompanies who have had Project involvement prior to Agnico Eagle's Project interest include Amoco Canada Petroleum Company Ltd. (Amoco), Campbell Red Lake Mines (Campbell), Dome Mines Ltd. (Dome), Placer Dome Inc. (Placer Dome), Pelangio-Larder Mines Limited (Pelangio-Larder), Franco-Nevada Mining Company Limited (FrancoNevada), Marl Resources Corp. (Marl Resources), Pelangio Mines Inc. (Pelangio), Trade Winds Ventures Inc. (Trade Winds), Goldcorp Canada Ltd. (Goldcorp), Detour Gold Corporation (Detour Gold), and Kirkland Lake Gold. Work completed included geological mapping, geochemical surveys (rock chip, grab, channel, trench, and soil sampling), airborne geophysical surveys, ground geophysical surveys (Crone electromagnetic, RADEM, magnetometer, induced polarization), core and reverse circulation (RC) drilling, metallurgical testwork, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, mining studies, environmental studies, and geotechnical and hydrological studies. Campbell mined the Campbell open pit from 1983-1987. Placer Dome conducted underground operations from 1987-1999 and briefly restarted open pit mining in 1998. Detour Gold commenced operations at the Detour Lake Pit in 2013.\nSince acquisition of the Project in 2022, Agnico Eagle has completed additional exploration drilling, Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates and continued with permitting of the western extent of the Detour Lake Pit (formerly referred to as the West Detour project).\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.7 Drilling And Sampling\n\nCore drilling completed on the Project (including 58N) to 16 October, 2023, within the database totals 8,975 drill holes $(2,521,852 \\mathrm{~m})$.\nDrilling and assaying that supports the Mineral Resource estimate for the Detour Lake deposit was completed by Placer Dome, Trade Winds, Pelangio, and Detour Gold from 1974-2016. Within the immediate area of the Mineral Resource estimate, there is a total of 5,768 core drill holes $(1,027,138 \\mathrm{~m})$.\nDrilling and assaying that supports the Mineral Resource estimate for the area formerly reported as the West Detour project was completed from 1996-2021 by Placer Dome,Trade Winds, Pelangio, Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold. Within the immediate area of the Mineral Resource estimate, there is a total of 2,456 core drill holes ( $943,701 \\mathrm{~m}$ ).\n\nDrilling and assaying that supports the Mineral Resource estimate for the Zone 58N deposit was completed by Detour Gold from 2012-2017. Within the immediate area of the Mineral Resource estimate, there is a total of 370 core drill holes (138,433 m).\n\nCore drilling from surface included the following core size diameters: AQ ( 27 mm ), BQ ( 36.4 mm ) and NQ ( 47.6 mm ). Core drilling from underground included the following core size diameters: EX (21 mm), AQ (27 mm), BQ ( 36.4 mm ), BQTK ( 40.7 mm ) and NQ $(47.6 \\mathrm{~mm})$.\n\nGeological and geotechnical logging has evolved over the various exploration and mining campaigns. Standard procedures for logging during the legacy (pre-Trade Winds) campaigns were not well documented and varied considerably between programs. Trade Winds used the same pre-set terminology and codes as the Placer Dome programs. Detour Gold developed a geological legend for the Project area incorporating advances in understanding of the regional and local geology, and the deposit-scale geology, structure, alteration, and mineralization. Agnico Eagle generally uses the Detour Gold logging lithology legend and codes.\n\nSurface collar surveys include a mix of measurements from cut grids, and differential global positioning system (DGPS) instruments. The initial position and azimuth of most underground holes was typically determined using measurements from underground survey stations and reference points.\n\nDown-hole surveys have used acid tests, and Tropari, Sperry Sun, Flexit SmartTool, Reflex EZ-Shot, Reflex Maxibor II, and Reflex Gyro Sprint-IQ instruments. Depending on the campaign and instrumentation being used, survey data could be collected at 3-75 m intervals downhole.\n\nIn general, core recovery exceeded 95\\% with losses generally occurring within overburden, the first few metres of bedrock, or when going through a fault zone.\n\nGrade control drilling uses RC methods.\nCore was typically split for sampling, with one half sent for assay and the other half retained as a reference. A small percentage of the core drilled during Agnico Eagle's ownership was not sawn and was shipped as whole core samples. Sample intervals ranged from 0.31.5 m .\n\nFor the Detour Lake deposit, Kirkland Lake Gold reviewed available bulk density values, and for the current Mineral Resource estimate, a density value was estimated using an inverse distance weighting to the third power (ID3) interpolation method and used the gold search parameters. Lithologies without a bulk density were assigned an average density of $2.99 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$. The resource estimate uses an average value of $2.95 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ for the area formerly termed the West Detour project, based on 15,120 determinations that were completed byKirkland Lake Gold in February 2022. The Zone 58N estimate uses an average value of $2.8 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, based on 2,644 measurements by Detour Gold.\n\nA number of laboratories were used over the Project history. Where known, the laboratories used during the legacy programs included Assayers Limited, in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, (Assayers); the Dome Mine Laboratory in Timmins (Dome laboratory), Ontario; Swastika Laboratories Ltd, in Swastika, Ontario (Swastika); the Detour Lake Mine assay laboratory (Detour Lake laboratory); X-Ral Laboratories in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec (X-Ral); Bondar Clegg in Ottawa, Ontario (Bondar Clegg); Chemex Laboratories in Mississauga, Ontario (Chemex Mississauga); Chemex Laboratories in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec (Chemex Rouyn-Noranda); Accurassay Laboratories in Thunder Bay, Ontario (Accurassay Thunder Bay); and Activation Laboratories Ltd in Timmins, Ontario (Actlabs). Accreditations at the time the work was performed is not known. All laboratories other than the Dome laboratory and the Detour Lake laboratory were independent of the operators at the time. All laboratories were independent of Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle. Trade Winds and Detour Gold used SGS Minerals in Garson, Ontario (SGS Garson), SGS Minerals in Don Mills, Ontario (SGS Don Mills), Accurassay in Timmins, Ontario (Accurassay Timmins), Accurassay in Thunder Bay, Ontario (Accurassay Thunder Bay), ALS Minerals in Sudbury, Ontario (ALS Sudbury), and ALS Minerals in Vancouver, B.C. (ALS Vancouver). Where known, the laboratories held ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Trade Winds, Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle. From 2020-2023, Kirkland Lake Gold and Agnico Eagle used ALS Minerals, with sample preparation completed at ALS Timmins and analysis at ALS Vancouver. Exploration samples were also submitted to Actlabs, SGS Laboratories in Cochrane (SGS Cochrane), and AGAT Laboratories in Mississauga (AGAT). These laboratories conducted both sample preparation and analysis. The laboratories hold ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\nGrade control samples are analysed at SGS Cochrane and Actlabs. The laboratories currently hold ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\nSample preparation and analysis protocols varied during the legacy programs. Samples were typically crushed, ground, or pulverized, and assayed using either fire assay of a one-assay-ton sub-sample, an aqua regia digestion and ketone extraction method, atomic absorption (AA) or a pulp and metallics procedure. During the Detour Gold programs, samples were crushed, pulverized, and analyzed using either fire assaying with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish, an inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) finish, a gravimetric finish, metallic screen procedures, or an inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) finish. During the Agnico Eagle programs, samples were crushed, pulverized, and analyzed using AAS and samples $>10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ were analyzed with a gravimetric finish. Selected high-grade samples were analyzed using a screen metallics procedure.Grade control samples are crushed, pulverized, and assayed using assay with an ICP-OES finish. Sulphur and carbon analysis are completed on 17 m composites (equivalent to one bench) using LECO.\n\nQuality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) in the form of insertion of blanks, standard reference material (standards) and duplicates was not routinely practiced during legacy program submission of samples for analysis. The QA/QC for the legacy programs typically relied on the laboratory's internal protocols. After 1993, standards, blanks and duplicates were routinely inserted in the sample stream. Review of the available QA/QC program results do not indicate any problems with the analytical programs, and the gold analytical data are acceptable to support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.\n\nAgnico Eagle migrated the Detour Gold Access databases to a Fusion database. Agnico Eagle performed a major data verification exercise during the data migration process. Verification procedures included the review and modifications of coordinates, surveys, samples, lithologies, alteration, mineralization, deformation, structure, veining, and rock quality designation (RQD) data. Currently, logging, and geotechnical data are directly uploaded from the logging software. Collar survey data are uploaded from a (DGPS) Topcon GR3 instrument with a Nikon total station instrument. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), 1983 North American Datum (NAD83) system was used to record position data. Downhole survey data are uploaded from a Reflex Gyro SPRINT-IQ. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), 1983 North American Datum (NAD83) system was used to record position data. All data are checked using inbuilt software checking routines.\n\nSample security was managed by exploration staff from the drilling phase through to core processing and subsequent dispatching by contracted couriers directly to the analytical facilities. Sample collection was systematically monitored from the drill rigs to the core facility and storage area; this facility is a security-monitored and gated on-site preparation facility. Chain-of-custody procedures consist of sample submittal forms to be sent to the laboratory with sample shipments to ensure that all samples are received by the laboratory.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.8 Data Verification\n\nData verification programs were carried out by independent consultants and operations personnel over time.\n\nAgnico Eagle personnel re-verified the entire database during migration of the data from the three Access databases previously used to the current Fusion database.\n\nVerification programs completed by Agnico Eagle include daily sample dispatch review and reporting, review, and approval of drill logs prior to uploading into the Fusion database, and review and authorization of received assay data by the Senior Database Administrator and the QP prior to uploading into the Fusion database. Other checks completed by the QP include site visits, review of geological data collection and checks that the QA/QC procedures used by Agnico Eagle are consistent with standard industry practices.A complete verification and validation of analytical, geological, and survey information was completed for the data supporting this Report from January 2020 to 16 October, 2023.\n\nGood production reconciliation since the start of the mining operations at Detour Lake validates the assumptions of metal content and gold extraction. The QP considers that a reasonable level of verification has been completed and that no material issues have been left unidentified from the programs undertaken. The data are acceptable to be used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.9 Data Verification By Qualified Persons\n\nThe QPs individually reviewed the information in their areas of expertise, and concluded that the information supported Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation, and could be used in mine planning and in the economic analysis that supports the Mineral Reserve estimates and be used in the mine plan and economic analysis that supports the 2024 PEA.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.10 Metallurgical Testwork\n\nThe Detour Lake Operations process plant was constructed in 2012, commenced operations in 2013, and has been operating since. The plant design was based on metallurgical testwork completed during pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, conducted from 2009-2010. Most of the metallurgical testing was completed at SGS Lakefield Research Limited in Ontario (SGS Lakefield) with follow-up testwork (lead nitrate and oxygen control) carried out on-site by site personnel.\n\nMetallurgical testwork completed as part of the 2009 pre-feasibility study on Detour Lake included mineralogical examination; gravity recovery tests, including gravity recoverable gold tests; cyanide leach tests on gravity tailings; grade variability testing; barren solution recycle testing; cyanide destruction tests; preparation of tailings for chemical and physical characterization and environmental testing; and environmental testwork. During the 2010 Detour Lake feasibility study, tests focused on project optimization, and included evaluation of gold recovery versus grind size, use of oxygen in leach and crushing and grinding studies.\n\nSince those studies, extensive plant testwork has proved the benefit of leaching with high oxygen rates and lead nitrate. Four full grinding circuit surveys were completed by Detour Lake Operations personnel and modelled by third-party consultants using JKSimMet to assist with grinding circuit optimizations and characterization. The plant has been successful in maintaining plant recovery while increasing plant throughput. The plant is still expected to increase throughput to the rate of $28 \\mathrm{Mt} /$ year while maintaining plant recovery to historical levels by completing minor changes to the circuit. Improvements are planned for the gravity circuit to increase gold recovery by feeding cyclone underflow instead of cyclone feed to the gravity circuit. Improving grind fineness through reduction of ball-mill transfer size, process control improvement, increased ball-mill power; and expectation of reduced hardness of mineralization from Detour West and Saddle Zone. It is also plannedto reduce carbon-in-pulp solution losses by increasing elution frequency and better carbon regeneration; and minimizing gold-in-carbon losses by improving carbon management.\n\nWork conducted on the Zone 58 N area included head assaying, mineralogy, gravity concentration, cyanide leach tests. The mineralization was evaluated to check if the current process plant flowsheet could be used. Based on the results of the Zone 58N metallurgical testing, the existing Detour Lake process plant is capable of processing the Zone 58N mineralization.\n\nMetallurgical recovery forecasts are based on equations developed during the Detour Lake pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, modified with information of historical data. As the West Detour deposit has similar mineralogy to that of the Detour Lake deposit, the same recovery assumptions are used for the West Detour mineralization and Saddle Zone. The metallurgical recovery assumptions used in the 2024 Detour Lake Mine LOM plan average $91.6 \\%$ with the last years of reclaiming low grade stockpiles at $88 \\%$.\n\nThe variability of the ore in the Detour Lake Pit is related to the talc, copper, and sulphur content. The talc zone is mainly located on the southern end of the pit. Copper and sulphur are present throughout the pit in various quantities. High-talc ores are soft and process faster. High-talc ore used to impact recovery in the past and talc ores were limited to $15 \\%$ of the plant feed. However, the operations have shown that recovery can be maintained with very high lead nitrate dosage rates. Processing of $40 \\%$ talc ore starting in 2020 yielded similar recoveries as non-talc ore. Sulphur content can impact recovery, and blending strategies to avoid feeding the plant with ores over $2 \\%$ sulphur are in place and have worked successfully.\n\nCopper is an element that impacts cyanide and $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ consumption. It is managed by blending, if too high, and by controlling the slurry temperature to the leach feed. To avoid copper plating on the carbon, a control strategy on the cyanide/copper ratio is in place.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.11 Mineral Resource Estimates\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.11.1 Detour Lake\n\nThe 2024 Mineral Resource estimate consists of four block models: two above the Mineral Reserve pit, one below the Mineral Reserve pit, and one for Zone 58N. The models above the Mineral Reserve pit were estimated for open pit mining and used for Mineral Reserve estimation. These block models used only low-grade mineralization domains and were split along an arbitrary north-south limit at 590,300E. The east and west models above the Mineral Reserves pit were estimated in December 2020 and December 2023, respectively. The block model below the Mineral Reserve pit was completed in March 2024, after the open pit Mineral Reserves were estimated. It was prepared to support estimation of Mineral Resources assuming open pit and underground mining methods, and includes high-grade and low-grade mineralized domains. The block model for Zone 58N was completed in September 2018 by third-party consultants, G Mining Services Inc. (G Mining).Mineral Resources at the Detour Lake Mine are estimated for mineralization potentially amenable to open pit and underground mining methods. The drill hole database supporting the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves for the Detour Lake Mine estimate has a cutoff date of 16 October, 2023. The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of 31 March, 2024, the date used for mining depletion.\n\nIn the Detour Lake deposit area, low-grade domains were modelled using a reference threshold grade of $0.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. High-grade corridor domains used a $0.7 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ threshold. High-grade domains are contained within the low-grade domains and were used to support Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods. There are a total of 11 low-grade domains that expand above and below the Mineral Reserves pit. There are 43 high-grade zones, which were only used in the block model below the Mineral Reserves pit.\n\nA 3D model of all prior mined areas in the Detour Lake Mine was created from available plans and sections. Individual models were created for underground access, stopes, and the Campbell open pit. The voids reconcile reasonably well with prior mining records. This void model was used to deplete the block models.\n\nSample intervals were split into 0.1 m intervals, coded with zone wireframes, and composited to 2 m and 5 m intervals. Compositing was downhole, respecting the contacts defined by the zone wireframes.\n\nCapping was performed on a zone-by-zone basis using the 2 m and 5 m downhole composites. After applying capping the coefficient of variation was reduced from 3-10 to $1.6-3$, with metal lost under $10 \\%$ in most cases. This indicated that the database was appropriate for interpolation with ordinary kriging (OK) if care was taken to minimize the over smoothing of the estimates and judicious selection of the estimation parameters.\n\nFor the models above the reserve pit, density was assigned by rock type from 590,300E to the west, to the east the density was interpolated using an inverse distance weighting to the third power (ID3) interpolation method, with the same interpolation search ellipses as used for gold estimation. The same assumptions were used for the block model to the west, and below the reserve pit. Overburden was assigned a density of $1.8 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, the value for mineralized volcanic rocks was $2.95 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, and the sedimentary unit to the south was assigned a density of $2.85 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nContinuity analysis was completed by modelled zone using the capped 2 m and the 5 m composites.\n\nBelow the reserves pit a block size of $5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 7.25 \\mathrm{~m}$ was used. Above the reserve pit, the model used blocks of $10 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 10 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 7.25 \\mathrm{~m}$. Sub-cells were allowed. Block sizes were selected as appropriate to model the volume of the wireframes of the zones with the block model.\n\nDatamine was used to divide the parent blocks into sub-blocks defined by $X / 2, Y / 2$, and a variable block size in the $Z$ direction, to best fit the volumes into the block model.\n\nDensity was assigned and gold grades were estimated into the parent cell.The interpolation method used to estimate the gold grades in the block models above and below the reserve pit was an OK algorithm. An inverse distance weighting to the second power (ID2) interpolation, and nearest neighbour (NN) estimates were completed concurrent to the OK estimate for validation purposes.\n\nTo attempt to honour the distribution of local mineralization trends, a dynamic anisotropy process was implemented.\n\nAll mineralized zones were estimated using hard boundaries, a decision that was supported by examination of boundary analysis plots.\n\nFor the low-grade domains below the pit and above the pit, west of 590,300E, the interpolation approach was similar. It was estimated with six passes of contracting volumes, such as: pass 6 used a $50 \\times 30 \\times 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ search ellipse, pass 5 used a $100 \\times 60 \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m}$ search ellipse. Additionally, passes six and five used a minimum of five composites and maximum of 10 composites to estimate the grade in a block. Passes four to one used a minimum of three composites and maximum of 10 composites. The maximum number of composites per drill hole was two in all cases. Estimated blocks could be re-estimated in subsequent passes.\n\nThe OK gold grade was validated using a combination of visual inspection, statistical evaluation, swath plots, reconciliation with past mining results, and comparison with grade control RC data. No material biases were noted in the estimation.\n\nMineral Resources considered potentially amenable to open pit mining methods were classified as follows:\n\n- Measured: blocks informed by a minimum of three drillholes, with a maximum drillhole space of 20 m ;\n- Indicated: blocks were assigned a classification of Indicated if the block was informed by a minimum of three drill holes, was estimated within the first two estimation passes ( $100 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 60 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m}$ ), and informed by at least one drill hole with a composite within 50 m of the block;\n- Inferred: Blocks were classified as Inferred if the block was informed by a minimum of two drill holes, was estimated within the first four estimation passes ( $200 \\mathrm{~m} \\times$ $120 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 40 \\mathrm{~m}$ ), and informed by at least one drill hole with a composite within 100 m of the block.\n\nMineral Resources considered potentially amenable to underground mining methods were classified as follows:\n\n- Measured: no blocks were classified as Measured;\n- Indicated: blocks were assigned a classification of Indicated if the block was informed by a minimum of three drill holes, was estimated within the shortest estimation pass ( $25 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ ), and informed by all the drilling within a maximum of 50 m drill spacing to the block;- Inferred: blocks were classified as Inferred if the block was informed by a minimum of two drill holes, was estimated within up to the second short estimation passes $(50 \\times 50 \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m})$, and informed by the drilling within a 100 m drill spacing to the block.\n\nThe criteria used to classify Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods were more restrictive than the classification used for the Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit mining methods because the mineralization continuity is lower when using the elevated cut-off grade for the underground estimate.\n\nMineral Resources amenable to open pit mining were constrained within a pit shell optimized using the Vulcan software. A revenue factor of 1 was used to guide the pit design. The model was depleted with past open pit and underground mining as at 31 March, 2024. The estimate is reported using a cut-off grade of $0.25 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\nA cut-off grade of $1.22 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ was calculated to identify optimal mine stope optimizer shapes assuming a transverse longhole open stoping mining method. The method was evaluated as appropriate to the sub-vertical mineralization orientation. Stope optimizer shapes were set to a maximum height of 40 m , length of 20 m , and variable thickness with an average of 14.7 m dilution included.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.11.2 Zone 58N\n\nMineral Resources for Zone 58N were covered by a stand-alone model. The drill hole database supporting the Mineral Resource for Zone 58N was closed for estimation as at 3 September, 2018.\n\nThe mineralized domains for Zone 58N consist of 3D wireframes built in 2018 by G Mining. Nine principal sub-vertical mineralized conduits were identified in Zone 58N, based on alteration intensities described as moderate or stronger, plus an additional zone of mineralization present in the hanging wall, Zone 75.\nA composite length of 2 m was selected. Grades were capped prior to compositing. An assigned density of $2.7 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ was used.\nComposites within a $0.05 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ grade shell were selected and used to generate indicator variograms at various thresholds to identify directions of anisotropy. The range of the indicator variogram models was reduced to the drill spacing ( $25 \\times 25 \\mathrm{~m}$ ) above an indicator threshold of $1.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. A block size of $5 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m}$ was used.\nDue to the highly erratic distribution of gold grades at Zone 58N, a five-pass interpolation strategy was adopted. Validation completed included visual checks on plan and section, global statistical checks using descriptive statistics, swath plots, and quantile-quantile checks on smoothing. No material biases were noted.\n\nThe following parameters were used to determine the Mineral Resource classification for Zone 58N:\n\n- Measured: There are no blocks classified as Measured;\n- Indicated: blocks estimated in passes 1, 2 and 3 above elevation 5780 mRL;- Inferred: blocks estimated in pass 4, in addition to estimation passes 1, 2 and 3 below elevation 5780 mRL ;\n- All material below elevation 5780 mRL is classified as Inferred due to the wider drill hole spacing.\n\nThe mining assumption for the Zone 58N deposit is that it will be mined using underground mining methods including transverse and longitudinal long-hole stopes. The mineralized domains were modelled with a minimum thickness of 4 m downhole (approximately 3 m true thickness), to ensure that minimum underground mining widths were addressed.\n\nThe estimate is reported using a cut-off grade of $2.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.12 Mineral Resource Statement\n\nMineral Resources are reported in situ, using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards and are reported exclusive of those Mineral Resources converted to Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\nMineral Resources are reported in Table 1-1 and Table 1-2. The Mineral Resources have an effective date of 31 March, 2024.\n\nThe Qualified Person for the estimates is Ms. Dyane Duquette, P.Geo., an Agnico Eagle employee.\n\nFactors that may affect the Mineral Resource estimates include changes to: metal price and exchange rate assumptions; assumptions used to generate the estimation domains; local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of mineralized zones; geological and mineralization shape and geological and grade continuity assumptions; treatment of high-grade gold values; density assignments; geotechnical, including locations of historically mined-out voids, mining and metallurgical recovery assumptions; input and design parameter assumptions that pertain to the assumptions for open pit and underground mining constraining the estimates; and assumptions as to the continued ability to access the site, retain mineral and surface rights titles, maintain environment and other regulatory permits, and maintain the social license to operate.Table 1-1: Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource Statement\n\n| Zone | Assumed <br> Mining <br> Method | Cut-off <br> Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Measured |  |  | Indicated |  |  | Measured and Indicated |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |  | Tonnes <br> (kt) | Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Contained <br> Ounces <br> (koz Au) | Tonnes <br> (kt) | Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Contained <br> Ounces <br> (koz Au) | Tonnes <br> (kt) | Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Contained <br> Ounces <br> (koz Au) |\n| Detour Lake | Open pit | 0.25 | 35,586 | 1.08 | 1,235 | 620,524 | 0.57 | 11,412 | 656,110 | 0.60 | 12,647 |\n| Detour Lake | Underground | 1.22 | - | - | - | 10,008 | 2.02 | 652 | 10,008 | 2.02 | 652 |\n| Zone 58N | Underground | 2.2 | - | - | - | 2,868 | 5.80 | 534 | 2,868 | 5.80 | 534 |\n| Detour Lake Total |  |  | 35,586 | 1.08 | 1,235 | 633,400 | 0.62 | 12,598 | 668,985 | 0.64 | 13,833 |\n\nTable 1-2: Inferred Mineral Resource Statement\n\n| Zone | Assumed <br> Mining <br> Method | Cut-off Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Inferred |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  |  | Tonnes <br> (kt) | Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Contained <br> Ounces <br> (koz Au) |\n| Detour Lake | Open pit | 0.25 | 78,647 | 1.52 | 3,850 |\n| Detour Lake | Underground | 1.22 | 56,809 | 2.04 | 3,718 |\n| Zone 58N | Underground | 2.2 | 973 | 4.35 | 136 |\n| Detour Lake Total Inferred |  |  | 136,430 | 1.76 | 7,704 |\n\nNotes to accompany Mineral Resource tables:\n\n1. The Mineral Resources have an effective date of 31 March, 2024. The Qualified Person for the estimates is Ms. Dyane Duquette, P.Geo., an Agnico Eagle employee.\n2. Mineral Resources are reported in situ, exclusive of those Mineral Resources converted to Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral Resources are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.\n3. Mineral Resources considered amenable to open pit mining methods at the Detour Lake Mine were estimated a gold price of US\\$1,650/oz, an assumed exchange rate of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$ 1.30$, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions based on formulae, $2 \\%$ royalty, $0.5 \\%$ First Nations royalty, mining costs of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 4.33 / \\mathrm{t}$ mined and an incremental bench cost of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 0.0197 / \\mathrm{t} /$ bench, process costs of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 10.74 / \\mathrm{t}$ milled, general and administrativecosts of C\\$3.33/t milled, non-mining sustaining capital costs of C\\$4.07/t milled, mining sustaining capital costs of C\\$0.55/t mined, and variable pit slope angles that range from $22-58^{\\circ}$. The estimate is reported using a cut-off grade of $0.25 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n4. Mineral Resources considered amenable to underground mining methods at the Detour Lake Mine were estimated assuming long-hole and transverse stoping methods. The estimates used a gold price of US\\$1,650/oz, an assumed exchange rate of C\\$/US $\\$ 1.30,91.9 \\%$ mill recovery, $2.0 \\%$ royalty, $0.8 \\%$ First Nations royalty, mining costs of C $\\$ 53.01 / t$ mined ( $40-\\mathrm{m}$ high stopes), process costs of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 10.15 / \\mathrm{t}$ mined, general and administrative costs of C\\$12.83/t mined. The estimate is reported using a cut-off grade of $1.22 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are reported within mineable shapes including mining dilution and Inferred Resources are reported excluding mining dilution.\n5. Mineral Resources considered amenable to underground pit mining methods at Zone 58 N were estimated assuming long-hole and transverse stoping methods. The estimates used a gold price of US1,300/oz, metallurgical recovery assumption of $97 \\%$, refining and transport costs of C\\$5/oz Au, average mining cost of C\\$75/t mined, process and tailings costs of C\\$9/t milled, general and administrative costs of C\\$11.50/t, assumed dilution average of $12 \\%$. The estimate is reported using a cut-off grade of $2.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n6. Estimates have been rounded in accordance with reporting guidelines. Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.13 Mineral Reserve Estimates\n\nMineral Reserves were estimated using a merged Mineral Resources model completed in December 2023 to the west of 590,300E and 2020 to the east of this limit. Mineral Reserves were depleted to 31 March, 2024.\nMineral Reserves are reported as the diluted ore tonnage and grade scheduled to be fed to the mill over the life of the operation, based on open pit mining methods. The associated production schedule considers an optimized mill and stockpile strategy to maximize discounted cash flows.\n\nMeasured and Indicated Mineral Resources within the Detour Lake pits were converted to Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, respectively.\n\nEach deposit was optimized independently to reflect the different bench height planned for that pit. The parameters and respective values assumed in the pit optimization process are presented in Table 1-3.\n\nBased on the costs and price assumptions presented in Table 1-3, a set of pit shells associated with a range of revenue factors was generated for each of the deposits. The final pit selection was based on conventional best-worst case analysis of discounted cashflows.\n\nThe engineered pit designs were completed using the pit optimization shells as a guide in order to maximize the value and gold recovered inside the ultimate pits. The resulting pit designs include practical geometry that is required in an operational mine, such as the haul road to access all the benches, recommended pit slopes with geotechnical berms, proper benching configuration and smoothed pit walls.\n\nThe cut-off evaluation incorporated considerations of mill and stockpile capacities, mine constraints and economic parameters when defining mill and stockpile cut-off grades over time in a yearly basis. An elevated cut-off of $0.30 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ is used as a minimum in the cutoff grade optimization process. Mining will use a variable cut-off grade strategy because it moves forward ounce production and delays stripping as much as possible as it aims to maximize discounted cash flows.\n\nMine dilution is accounted for by the use of mine panels that emulate variable degrees of dilution as a function of the continuity of the mineralization at different cut-off grades.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.14 Mineral Reserve Statement\n\nMineral Reserves are reported at the point of delivery to the process plant, or in stockpiles, using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards. The Qualified Person for the estimate is Mr. Andre Leite, P.Eng., an Agnico Eagle employee. Mineral Reserves have an effective date of 31 March, 2024 and are summarized in Table 1-4.

The Mineral Reserves have an effective date of 31 March, 2024. The Qualified Person for the estimate is Mr. Andre Leite, P.Eng., an Agnico Eagle employee.\n2. Mineral Resources are reported at the point of delivery to the process plant. Mineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.\n3. Mineral Reserves amenable to open pit mining methods were estimated using a gold price assumption of US\\$1,400/oz, an exchange rate of $1.30 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$$, a $2 \\%$ net smelter return royalty, $0.5 \\%$ First Nations royalty, refining charge of $0.28 \\%$, variable metallurgical recoveries based on a formula, inter-ramp pit slope angles that range from $22.0-58.0^{\\circ}$, mining cost (inc. vertical incremental cost) of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 4.33 / \\mathrm{t}$ mined, process costs of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 10.74 / \\mathrm{t}$ milled, general and administrative costs of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 2.97 / \\mathrm{t}$ milled, non-mining capital costs of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 4.07 / \\mathrm{t}$ milled, and mining capital costs of C\\$0.55/t mined. The estimate is reported above a minimum cut-off grade of $0.30 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n4. Estimates were rounded in accordance with reporting guidelines. Totals may not sum due to rounding.Factors that may affect the Mineral Reserve estimates include: changes to the gold price and exchange rate assumptions; changes to pit slope and geotechnical assumptions; changes to operating cost assumptions used in the constraining pit shell; changes to pit designs from those currently envisaged; unforeseen dilution; changes to hydrogeological and pit dewatering assumptions; changes to inputs to capital and operating cost estimates; ability to permit West Detour and North Pit pits and western extent of the ultimate Detour Lake pit; and changes to modifying factor assumptions, including environmental, permitting and social licence to operate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.15 Mining Methods\n\nThe geotechnical design parameters for Detour Lake Pit were reviewed by Golder in 2021. A process of ongoing geotechnical monitoring and documentation was implemented at the mine and additional risk mitigation techniques continue to be evaluated and employed as needed.\n\nThe mine water management plan is matched to the mine development strategy. Water management infrastructure includes non-contact water diversion structures and water retention ponds, appropriately sized based on hydrological/hydrogeological modelling and the changes in mining activity and stockpiling over the LOM.\n\nThe mine operation requires the management of old underground workings; in general, historical records of underground workings are very reliable. Standard operational procedures regulate the mining activity in these affected areas to ensure a safe operation and risk management.\n\nThere are a total of eight phases designed for the Detour Lake Pit and one for the North Pit.\nBoth waste rock storage facility (WRSF) and stockpile strategies are in agreement with the permitting strategy, and respect related environmental constraints. Currently the mine has two WRSFs (MRS1 and MRS2), two ore stockpile (ROMPAD and MRS2SP) and one overburden/topsoil stockpile for mine reclamation purposes (OVB1). The mine plan includes provision for two additional ore stockpiles (MRS4 and MRS5), three new WRSFs (MRS3, MRS2-extension and in-pit) and one new overburden/topsoil stockpile (West Detour Overburden stock).\n\nThe Detour Lake Pit is mined using conventional truck-shovel open pit mining. The mine is operated using an Owner-operator mining equipment and labour strategy. Excluding the muskeg and overburden/till top layer, all material must be blasted. Pioneering drilling and blasting is required in the overburden/rock contact. During winter months, occasional blasting may be required due to frost.\n\nThe mine operates 24 -hr per day year-round on 12 hr shifts for all operational crews. Operational teams work on either a seven-day in/seven-day out or a 14-day in/14-day out rotation. Management/supervisory and support personnel work at site on different schedules.The mine production schedule forecasts a total $2,088 \\mathrm{Mt}$ to be mined over a period of 20 years (2024-2044). A total of 818 Mt of ore is planned to be milled over a period of 30 years (2024-2053); with the last nine years of production supported by long-term stockpile reclaim. The optimized and variable cut-off strategy combined with 248 Mt of stockpile capacity, results in an average LOM stripping ratio of 1.76 .\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.16 Recovery Methods\n\nThe process plant is based on a robust metallurgical flowsheet designed for optimum recovery with minimum operating costs. The flowsheet is based upon unit operations that are well proven in industry.\n\nThe primary crushing system is a single stage, open circuit, primary gyratory crusher that feeds a secondary cone crusher operated in open circuit. The gold recovery circuit selected was a leach circuit followed by a carbon-in-pulp (CIP) circuit. The mineralization then proceeds to acid wash, stripping, electrowinning, and refining.\nThe process plant was designed to process ore at an average throughput of $55,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ or $20 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$, equivalent to milling rates of 2,500 tonnes per operating hour ( $\\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{oh}$ ) with operating time of $92 \\%$ in a 24 hour day. While operating time has lagged at around $90 \\%$, the milling rate has far exceeded the design rate averaging $3,325 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ in 2023 for 25.4 Mt milled.\n\nWith the upturn of current performance of the process plant, ongoing optimization efforts and some new capital initiatives, the LOM plan assumes that the plant throughput will increase from $25.4 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2023 to $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2025 and thereafter. The annual plant throughput of $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ is planned to be achieved by increasing the milling rate to $3,474 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ and improving operating time to $92 \\%$. Various initiatives have been developed to bring the plant to the $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate. Additional initiatives have been identified to further improve the process plant's operating flexibility, and to mitigate risks associated with tonnage increases.\n\nThe LOM plan assumes that the $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate will use 778,000 MWh per year, which the plant electrical system is adequately designed to supply.\n\nA barge reclaim water system is used to reclaim and pump water from the tailings management area (TMA) back to the process plant to satisfy process water requirements. Depending on the water balance in the TMA, water from the open pit and various collection ditches around the WRSFs can also be directed to the plant. Make-up water for the reagent mixing is sourced from East Lake when required.\n\nConsumables used in the plant include: steel balls; quicklime (CaO); sodium cyanide $(\\mathrm{NaCN})$ for gold dissolution and desorption; $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and SMBS; anti-scalant; caustic; copper sulphate; carbon is used for gold collection; and ore anti-freeze conditioner.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.17 Project Infrastructure\n\nSurface infrastructure to support operations is primarily in place, and includes:- Two open pits: Detour Lake Pit (in operation) and North Pit (to be constructed);\n- Processing facilities: grinding and leaching facilities, along with management and engineering offices, change house, workshop, warehouse, and assay laboratory (currently under construction) facilities;\n- Mine facilities: management and engineering offices, change house, heavy mining vehicle and light vehicle workshops (currently undergoing expansion), wash bay, warehouse, explosives magazine, crusher, mine access gate house, return water pump house;\n- Administration buildings: facilities for overall site management, safety inductions, and general and administrative functions;\n- Accommodation camp;\n- Four stockpiles: ROM pad, MRS4 (under construction), MRS5 (planned construction) and MRS2;\n- Four WRFs: MRS1, MRS2, MRS3 (planned construction) and in-pit (planned construction);\n- Four tailings storage facilities: Cells 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Cell 3 and Cell 4 are currently at the design stage);\n- Water management facilities: stormwater and water storage dams, diversions, culverts;\n- Landfill facility;\n- Airfield and aerodrome facility.\n\nFacilities in Cochrane include administration offices, a bus terminal with employee parking lot and security check-ins, four houses and an eight-unit apartment block. Agnico Eagle has a shared services centre in Timmins, Sudbury, and North Bay that services the Detour Lake Mine. SGS Minerals operates a full-service analytical laboratory in Cochrane in support of the Detour Lake Mine.\n\nWorkers are accommodated in two camps. The Little Hopper Lodge (previously referred to as the Permanent Camp) is located 7 km west of the mining operations in close proximity to Little Hopper Lake. The Sagimeo Lodge is located just south of the mine services building. Accommodations have a capacity of 1,435 people with an additional 275 rooms available as an overflow.\n\nPotable water for the Little Hopper Lodge is obtained from Little Hopper Lake. This is adequate for the Detour Lake's current and future needs. Potable water for the Sagimeo Lodge, mine services facilities, site administration facility, and the process plant is obtained from borehole wells close to the camp. Fresh water is pumped from East Lake and is primarily used in the process plant for reagent mixing but is also used as wash water in the truck wash facility and water make-up for the fire water tank.The existing 180 km -long powerline runs from the processing facility to a tie in at Island Falls, and thence to the Pinard substation. The 230 kV transmission line allows for the distribution of more than 85 MW of power, suitable to service the entire Detour Lake Operations. In the event of a power failure, there is sufficient emergency power generation for the provision of basic services.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.18 Environmental, Permitting And Social Considerations\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.18.1 Environmental And Supporting Studies\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine Area has been subject to extensive baseline, environmental monitoring, and technical studies, as per provincial and federal regulatory requirements. Monitoring of various environmental factors has continued throughout the operating period, generating an extensive environmental dataset that supports site management and permitting efforts.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.18.2 Monitoring\n\nDetour Lake Mine operates in a highly regulated jurisdictions with federal, provincial, and site-specific permit compliance and monitoring requirements. Agnico Eagle notes the following monitoring programs in particular:\n\n- Air and noise: The mine is required to comply with air quality standards, point of impingement guidelines, and ambient air quality criteria specified in Ontario Reg. 419/05. The installed operating monitoring systems demonstrate compliance with these standards, which confirms the predictions of no significant air quality or noise impacts.\n- Water quality: the monitoring network includes approximately 87 surface water stations and 152 groundwater stations. Regular data collection, analysis, and interpretation on a monthly and quarterly basis allow for risk identification and adaptive management;\n- Fisheries and other aquatic resources: mitigation measures were implemented to limit potential effects related to mining of the Detour Lake Pit on aquatic resources. Additional mitigation measures and compensations plans are in the final stages of review to address potential impacts to fisheries and other aquatic resources related to continued mine development.\n- Vegetation and wildlife: measures to minimize adverse effects to area plants and wildlife include but are not limited to: optimizing the Project footprint; maintaining a minimum 120 m buffer around watercourses; avoidance of unnecessary disturbance to wetlands; and avoidance of tree clearing during the bird nesting period. Recommendations for the protection of Woodland Caribou include as reasonable: minimizing the overall project footprint; avoidance of critical over-wintering habitat; minimizing disturbance to mature upland black spruce-jack pine forests that support a high abundance of terrestrial and arboreal lichens (a preferred food source); andminimizing the potential for caribou/vehicular traffic interaction. Agnico Eagle has also implemented a caribou tracking and monitoring program.\n\n- Cultural and heritage resources: none of the studies completed identified archaeological sites that are proximal to the mine site, including the West Detour area, which are likely to be affected by the mine in any foreseeable manner. The overall potential for encountering unforeseen cultural heritage or archaeological sites that would conflict with the proposed development plan for the site is considered to be low. An additional study conducted in late 2023 identified an archaeological site on the south shore of East Lake, which remains outside of any planned development for the mine.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.18.3 Tailings Management Area\n\nTailings are stored at surface in an engineered TMA presently located east of the process plant. The TMA consists of four cells being developed in a planned, progressive manner: Cell 1 was built over a historic tailings storage facility from a previous mining operation and deposition is substantially complete; Cell 2 was developed to the north of Cell 1 and is currently the active facility for deposition. The proposed location for Cell 3 is south of the mine water pond and is currently in the conceptual design and permitting stage; the proposed location for Cell 4 is just south of Cell 1 where the mine water pond is currently sited. The mine water pond is expected to be transferred to the North Pit in 2037, once the pit is mined out. The TMA is designed to function as independent cells for tailings and water management. Tailings deposition will generally occur in only one cell at any time with water recycled for process plant use occurring mainly from the active cells.\n\nThe initial design of the TMA was optimized during ongoing operations, as additional information became available through ongoing construction and in response to a requirement for additional capacity. In Q4 2020, tailings deposition was transitioned from Cell 1 to Cell 2. Transition from Cell 2 to Cell 3 is planned for 2029 followed by Cell 4 in 2037. Starting in 2044, tailings are to be deposited in the Detour Lake Pit (mine operation in the Detour Lake Pit is forecast to be complete in 2044). The TMA Cell 2, Cell 3, Cell 4, and Open Pit will provide for storage of approximately 893 Mt of tailings solids. Capital investment is reflected in the cash flow model.\n\nInspection and monitoring is performed during construction and operation of the tailings dams to assess their performance and safety; and to verify that actual conditions are consistent with the design assumptions and intent. Inspection and monitoring also optimizes maintenance and repair costs, provides warning of impending risks, and provides sufficient time to implement remedial measures, if required. A dam safety review completed in 2020 confirmed that the TMA is performing as designed. The next dam safety review is planned for 2025 .\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.18.4 Water Management\n\nEnvironmental protection is ensured through the water management network, which collects seepage and runoff from all mine waste facilities through a system of ditching,pumping, and pipeline infrastructure. The modular design allows for the addition of treatment facilities if required.\n\nIn 2020, a mine water pond with a capacity of $3.5 \\mathrm{Mm}^{3}$ was completed. The mine water pond serves as a central water management facility (e.g., for open pit water and local runoff), and provides additional contingencies for storage and treatment, if needed. The mine water pond will be relocated prior to transition of tailings deposition into Cell 4.\n\nTailings, tailings slurry water, and water reclaimed for the operation of the process plant are managed through the TMA.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.18.5 Permits\n\nThe existing Detour Lake Mine has received a number of approvals, authorizations, and operating permits from applicable regulatory agencies. Additional environmental permits, or amendments to existing permits, will be required to support ongoing operations, development, and proposed expansions to Detour Lake Mine. Required permits will be obtained prior to the commencement of applicable development or operating activities.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.18.6 Closure And Reclamation\n\nAgnico Eagle acknowledges it will be responsible for providing the full amount of the financial assurance for the closure and rehabilitation of Detour Lake Mine, subject to any required or approved changes to the Closure Plan. Closure costs were included in the economic analysis that supports the Mineral Reserves.\n\nOver the LOM, there will be developmental phases (e.g., the construction and initiation of deposition into a new tailings cell) that trigger the issuance of additional security bonding for the operation. Financial assurance is submitted to the Ministry of Mines prior to the beginning of the associated activities of each phase, or as otherwise arranged with the Ministry of Mines. Based on Detour Lake Mine's current phase of development, security provided to the Ministry of Mines to date totals approximately C\\$232 million. Financial assurance associated with proposed expansions will be formalized through subsequent Closure Plan Amendments.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.18.7 Social Considerations\n\nAgnico Eagle has undertaken ongoing consultation with the public, government regulators and its Indigenous partners regarding the operations, environmental commitments, and planned activities. Agnico Eagle has established the following consultation principles:\n\n- Early notification;\n- Open communication;\n- Accessible information;\n- Flexible process;\n- Capacity building;- Mutual respect.\n\nThese principles continue to guide interactions within mine permitting, operations, and exploration.\n\nAgnico Eagle has agreements with several First Nation and Métis communities who have treaty and Indigenous rights asserted within the operations area of Detour Lake Mine. These agreements provide a framework for strengthened collaboration in the development and operations of the mine and outlines tangible benefits for the Indigenous communities, including direct financial support, skills training and employment, opportunities for business development and contracting, and a framework for issues resolution, regulatory permitting and Agnico Eagle's future financial contributions. In addition, Agnico Eagle consults Indigenous communities in connection with permitting applications and ongoing projects.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.19 Markets And Contracts\n\nNo market studies are currently relevant as the Detour Lake Mine is an operating mine producing a readily-saleable commodity in the form of doré. Doré is sent via secure transportation to a refinery for further refining. Agnico Eagle sells its gold production into the market at spot prices. The estimated bullion transport costs, liability charges and refining costs used for the financial analysis are based on contract prices agreed with thirdparties.\n\nCommodity prices used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are set by Agnico Eagle at the corporate level. The current gold price provided for Mineral Reserve estimation is US\\$1,400/oz, and US\\$1,650/oz for Mineral Resource estimation. Both Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates use an exchange rate assumption of 1.30 C\\$/US\\$.\n\nAgnico Eagle has a number of contracts, agreement, and/or purchase orders in place for supply and services that are material to the operation. All contracts or agreements are negotiated with vendors and have a contractual scope, terms, and conditions. Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed. Contract terms are considered to be within industry norms, and typical of similar contracts in Canada with which Agnico Eagle is familiar.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.20 Capital Cost Estimates\n\nCapital costs consist largely of deferred stripping using a by-phase approach, construction of tailings cells and dam raises, mining equipment (replacements, additions, component replacements, capitalized maintenance), and sustaining capital for the process plant.\n\nCapital costs for the first three years of plan are based on budget cycle estimates with supplier quotes, engineered designs, maintenance strategies, production plans or preliminary estimates. Estimates in later years are based on maintenance strategies, equipment replacement schedules, and long-term sustaining capital estimates based onrecent operating history. Tailings cell costs are based on physical material movement requirements and recent unit cost history.\n\nThe LOM capital cost estimate is provided in Table 1-5. The LOM plan estimated total capital cost is $\\mathbf{C} \\$ 7,842$ million.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.21 Operating Cost Estimates\n\nOperating costs are based on actual costs seen during operations at site and are projected through the LOM primarily using zero-based budgeting principles.\n\nAll operating costs were evaluated on an annual basis and include all costs related to:\n\n- Mining ore and waste;\n- Processing ore;\n- All expenses associated with site administration;\n- Adjustments for deferred stripping and changes in stockpile inventory;\n- Royalties;\n- Payments related to agreements with First Nations.\n\nThe consumables for the operation are based on a combination of current prices, contracts for future years and Agnico Eagle's view of long-term pricing, sourced from the previous life-of-mine plan, recent historical prices, and specialized third-party advisors.\n\nIn general, approximately $87 \\%$ of operating costs are based in Canadian dollars and 13\\% have US dollar exposure. The exchange rate used in the financial model is 1.34 C\\$/US\\$.\n\nThe LOM operating cost estimate is provided in Table 1-6. The LOM plan estimated total operating cost is $\\mathbf{C} \\$ 18,048$ million. The LOM mining unit cost in $\\mathbf{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{t}$ mined is $\\mathbf{C} \\$ 4.16 / \\mathrm{t}$ expit. The LOM minesite cost in C\\$/t milled is C\\$22.05/t milled. The LOM minesite cost in C\\$/oz produced is C\\$1,002/oz produced.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.22 Economic Analysis\n\nThis section is not relevant to this Report as Agnico Eagle is a producing issuer, the operations are currently in production, and there is no material expansion of current production planned.\n\nMineral Reserve declaration for the Detour Lake Operations is supported by a positive cash flow.Table 1-5: Capital Cost Summary by Area\n\n| Capital Cost Summary <br> (C\\$M) | 2024 <br> (Q2-Q4) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 2032-2043 <br> (Avg) | 2044 | 2045-2053 <br> (Avg) | LOM |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Deferred stripping | 136 | 285 | 276 | 278 | 206 | 211 | 165 | 163 | 77 | - | - | 2,645 |\n| Tailings management | 100 | 105 | 86 | 227 | 195 | 113 | 115 | 95 | 99 | - | - | 2,224 |\n| Mining ${ }^{1}$ | 192 | 225 | 248 | 133 | 96 | 98 | 89 | 98 | 64 | 23 | 11 | 2,075 |\n| Processing | 65 | 67 | 69 | 43 | 23 | 24 | 24 | 17 | 15 | 14 | 11 | 625 |\n| Site administration ${ }^{2}$ | 36 | 26 | 28 | 40 | 32 | 9 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 273 |\n| Total Capital Costs | $\\mathbf{5 3 0}$ | $\\mathbf{7 0 7}$ | $\\mathbf{7 0 7}$ | $\\mathbf{7 2 0}$ | $\\mathbf{5 5 2}$ | $\\mathbf{4 5 4}$ | $\\mathbf{3 9 9}$ | $\\mathbf{3 7 8}$ | $\\mathbf{2 6 0}$ | $\\mathbf{4 2}$ | $\\mathbf{2 5}$ | $\\mathbf{7 , 8 4 2}$ |\n\nNotes: 1.

Includes adjustments for deferred stripping, royalties, and changes in stockpile inventory.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.23 Risks And Opportunities\n\nThe major risks to the Detour Lake Operations are associated with:\n\n- Negative variations to the gold and diesel price assumptions;\n- Significant additional dilution or ore losses;\n- Significant delays in the assumed permitting timeline for the West Detour project;\n- Changes in the geotechnical assumptions;\n- Lower than planned plant production capacity;\n- Tailings cell seepage.\n\nThe major opportunities are:\n\n- Additional modifications to the process stream that may generate a higher than $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ plant capacity;\n- Investigation of the underground potential at Detour Lake based on the results of the 2024 PEA;\n- Further improvements in the grade control processes with the installation of an assay laboratory at the mine site;\n- Increased level of automation in the mine operation (upgrade of the mine network to long-term evolution will enable a higher level of automation);\n- Use of alternative energy sources to diesel with the intent of improving business sustainability and competitiveness.\n- Alternate tailings impoundment and treatment to reduce life-cycle costs and improve constructability.\n- Process water treatment and discharge to reduce water quality risks.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.24 Interpretation And Conclusions\n\nAn economic analysis was performed in support of estimation of Mineral Reserves; this indicated a positive cash flow using the assumptions and parameters detailed in this Report.\n\n### 1.252024 PEA\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.1 Introduction\n\nThis Report sub-section presents the results of the 2024 PEA on proposed underground operations at Detour Lake.The economic analysis is partly based on Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the 2024 PEA based on these Mineral Resources will be realized.\n\nThe production schedules and financial analysis annualized cash flow table are presented with conceptual years shown. Years shown in these tables are for illustrative purposes only. If additional mining, technical, and engineering studies are conducted, these may alter the Project assumptions as discussed in this Report and may result in changes to the calendar timelines presented.\n\nThe 2024 PEA results represent forward looking information.\nInformation on the property description and location is provided in Section 1.3. A summary of the mineral tenure and surface rights is included in Section 1.4. The geology and mineralization is provided in Section 1.5. Information on drilling and sampling is summarized in Section 1.7. Data verification is noted in Sections 1.8 and 1.9. Metallurgical testwork is summarized in Section 1.10. Information on the mineral resource estimate that supports the 2024 PEA is provided in Section 1.11.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.2 Mine Plan\n\nThe subset of the Mineral Resource estimate used in the 2024 PEA mine plan is provided in Table 1-7.\n\nThe mining method selected for the 2024 PEA is transverse longhole open stoping (LHOS). The level spacing will be 40 m and the stope panel length will be 20 m . Mining will be transverse with a minimum stope width of 8.0 m , with a planned equivalent linear overbreak slough dilution of 1.5 m on the hanging wall and 1.0 m on the footwall.\n\nThe underground mine will be divided into six mining regions according to their location in relation to the open pit, and mineralization will be directed to the crusher once it is operational. The stope mucking will be completed using automated load-haul-dump (LHD) vehicles. Mineralized material will be hauled to the main underground crushing system, and crushed prior to being conveyed to the surface.\n\nAccess to all underground workings will be via a main decline and conveyor ramp for material. The mineralized material will be transferred to the conveyor with trucks and material chutes.\n\nThe mining sequence will advance multiple pyramids in a bottom-up chevron sequence using primary and secondary stopes. Primaries will all be backfilled with cemented paste fill. Secondary backfill will be either cemented paste fill or waste rock fill according to the sequence and waste material available.\n\nThe ventilation system design is a push system capable of delivering more than $566.3 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}$ ( $1,200 \\mathrm{kcfm}$ ) of fresh air from surface to the underground workings.\n\nThe 2024 PEA mine plan assumes a five-year development period, a three-year operational ramp-up, and 12 years of production with an average mill feed of $11,200 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$.Table 1-7: Summary of the Mineral Resource Potentially Amenable to Underground Mining Methods\n\n| Confidence Classification | As at March 31, 2024 |  |  | Subset of Mineral Resource Estimate In 2024 PEA Mine Plan |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained Metal (Moz Au) | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained Metal (Moz Au) |\n| Indicated Mineral Resources |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Inside March 2024 Resource Pit | 9.0 | 1.83 | 0.5 | 4.5 | 2.34 | 0.3 |\n| Outside March 2024 Resource Pit | 10.0 | 2.02 | 0.7 | 4.5 | 2.37 | 0.3 |\n| Total Indicated | 19.0 | 1.94 | 1.2 | 9.0 | 2.36 | 0.7 |\n| Inferred Mineral Resources |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Inside March 2024 Resource Pit | 50.8 | 2.06 | 3.4 | 24.3 | 2.46 | 1.9 |\n| Outside March 2024 Resource Pit | 56.8 | 2.04 | 3.7 | 24.2 | 2.53 | 2.0 |\n| Total Inferred | 107.7 | 2.05 | 7.1 | 48.5 | 2.50 | 3.9 |\n\nNote:\n\n1. Mineral Resources are reported in situ, with an effective date of 31 March, 2024. The Qualified Person for the estimate is Ms. Dyane Duquette, P.Geo., an Agnico Eagle employee. Mineral Resources are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.\n2. Mineral Resources are reported exclusive of Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n3. Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods are reported within optimized stope shapes, using a cut-off grade of $1.22 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. Inputs into the shapes include a US\\$1,400/oz Au price, and optimal stope shapes of 40 m in height.\n4. The subset of the Mineral Resources within the 2024 PEA mine plan is reported using a cut-off of $1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\nThe underground development material grading $0.3-1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ could be directed to the lowgrade stockpile currently used for the Detour Lake open pit. This option would increase the gold production over the LOM and limit the amount of waste rock tonnage sent to the WRSF.\n\nFleet selection was based on the mine plan to optimize the rate with the production schedule requirements. The underground equipment fleet will be diesel-powered. A surface equipment fleet will complement the underground fleet bring in workers and manage the consumables on surface. The equipment fleet selected is conventional for modern underground operations.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.3 Recovery Plan\n\nThe process plant is based on a robust metallurgical flowsheet designed for optimum recovery with minimum operating costs. The flowsheet is based upon unit operations that are well proven in industry.\n\nWith the upturn of current performance of the process plant, ongoing optimization efforts and some new capital initiatives, the PEA plan assumes that the plant throughput will increase from $25.4 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2023 to $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2025 , and $29.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2028 and thereafter. The annual plant throughput of $29.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ is planned to be achieved by increasing the milling rate to $3,598 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ and improving operating time to $92 \\%$. Various initiatives have been developed to bring the plant to the $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate. Additional initiatives have been identified to improve the process plant's operating flexibility further, and to mitigate risks associated with tonnage increases.\n\nAn underground tie-in for the process plant is required for the 2024 PEA. Underground material will be crushed in underground facilities using a jaw crusher, then conveyed to surface. The underground mineralized material will be temporarily stockpiled near the refeed ore stockpile. Loaders and trucks will be used to dose underground mineralized material into the gyratory crusher feed. The strategy is to follow open pit production to ensure good blending of both sources and to control the gold grade feeding the mill. The mobile equipment is already available since it is currently used for the re-feed system.\n\nThe crushing and grinding circuit is in place and operational; however, optimizations are planned or underway in support of proposed operations and the 2024 PEA. The leach and carbon-in-pulp, acid wash, stripping, electrowinning, and refining, thickening, and tailings circuits are in place and operational. No changes are envisaged in the 2024 PEA.\n\nA paste backfill plant will be required to support the 2024 PEA. It will have a design capacity of $12,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ of paste using two production lines of $6,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ each, which is based on the assumption that $75 \\%$ of the underground stope volume will be filled with cemented paste backfill.\n\nPower, water, and reagent use is not expected to significantly change for the purposes of the 2024 PEA, assuming a $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ production rate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.4 Infrastructure\n\nThere is significant existing infrastructure in place to support the open pit operations. Additional infrastructure will be required to support the assumptions in the 2024 PEA:\n\n- Access portals;\n- Conveying system;\n- Two surface conveyors;\n- Paste plant;\n- Administration buildings and mine dry;- Warehouse and cold storage building;\n- Maintenance shop;\n- Expansion of accommodation facilities;\n- Compressor room;\n- Ventilation raises, ventilation support and heating;\n- Electrical substations and distribution lines;\n- IT and site communications;\n- Combustible and fuel storage.\n\nMost infrastructure will be located directly at the mine site; however, some offsite infrastructure must be upgraded to accommodate the underground mine proposed in the 2024 PEA.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.5 Environmental, Permitting And Social Considerations\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine area has been subject to extensive baseline, environmental monitoring, and technical studies, as per provincial and federal regulatory requirements. Monitoring of various environmental factors has continued throughout the operating period, generating an extensive environmental dataset that supports site management. This information is also used in support of the 2024 PEA.\n\nThe TMA is currently in place. The 2024 PEA envisages that all of the tailings from the underground operations can be stored in the existing TMA or using the planned open pit storage, using existing facilities.\n\nThe 2024 PEA envisages that the current water management practices will continue for the duration of the 2024 PEA mine plan.\n\nPermitting for the underground operations is planned to be completed in two separate phases for advanced exploration and production. Accelerating the permitting for preliminary development will allow the development of the services portal and ramp to commence while the associated economic and technical studies are completed for full production.\n\nThere is considered to be no additional social or community impacts from the 2024 PEA, and assumptions based on the current mining operation apply to the 2024 PEA.\n\nClosure costs as envisaged in the 2024 PEA are approximately $\\$ 40 \\mathrm{M}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.6 Markets And Contracts\n\nIt is expected that the 2024 PEA will use the same marketing methodology for the doré to be produced as the existing operations.\n\nThe gold price used for the Mineral Resource estimate was US\\$1,650/oz Au, with an exchange rate assumption of $1.30 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$$. The potentially-mineable stope shapes were constrained using a gold price of US\\$1,400/oz Au and an exchange rate assumption of 1.30C\\$/US\\$. The 2024 PEA financial analysis used a gold price of US\\$1,900/oz Au and an exchange rate assumption of $1.34 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.7 Capital Cost Estimates\n\nThe capital cost estimate includes the initial and sustaining capital costs for the underground project from 2024 to the end of underground mining operation in 2044. It excludes capital expenditures for the mill optimization to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$, and adjustments resulting from the integration with the open pit operation. The estimate base date is Q2 2024, with costs estimated in 2023 inflated by $3 \\%$ to bring them to 2024 dollars. No inflation value was attributed to the 2024 PEA project past the estimate base date.\nHarmonized Sales Tax (HST) was excluded from the estimate and no salvage value was included.\n\nCosts were divided between initial and sustaining capital costs, which included direct and indirect costs, Owner's costs, contingency, mining development, and sustaining costs.\nThe total initial capital cost totals C\\$964.3 M, the sustaining capital estimate is C\\$993.2 M, and closure costs are C\\$40 M (Table 1-8). The total estimated capital cost for the 2024 PEA is C\\$1,997.5 M.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.8 Operating Cost Estimates\n\nA portion of the initial operating costs incurred during pre-production are not included in the operating costs, and transferred to the capital expenditures.\n\nThe estimated operating costs, provided in Table 1-9, include the operating costs for the underground project as a standalone scenario and exclude adjustments related to the integration with the open pit operation. Operating cost forecasts total C\\$3.5 billion, averaging C\\$65.45/t of mineralized material processed.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.9 Economic Analysis\n\n## Cashflow Analysis\n\nThe project was valued using a discounted free cash flow approach. Estimates were prepared for all the individual elements of cash revenue and cash expenditures for ongoing operations. Free cash flow is assumed to occur in the middle of each period. The net present value was calculated as at 1 April, 2024.\n\nFinancial analysis of the underground project was prepared as the difference between a Base Case Scenario (\"Open Pit\") with process plant production at $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ and a scenario with additional production from underground starting in 2030, and a ramp-up in process plant production to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ by 2028 (\"Open Pit + Underground + Mill Optimization\"). The difference between these two scenarios represents the differential value of Underground and the Mill Expansion (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\").Table 1-8: 2024 PEA Capital Cost Estimate by Initial/Sustaining\n\n| Initial/Sustaining | Estimate Area | Total <br> (C\\$M) | Total <br> (\\%) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n|  | Direct | 433.5 | 21.7 |\n| Initial capital cost estimate | Direct contingency | 70.0 | 3.5 |\n|  | Indirect | 85.5 | 4.3 |\n|  | Indirect contingency | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n|  | Mining development | 214.9 | 10.8 |\n|  | Owner's cost | 160.5 | 8.0 |\n|  | Sub-total | 964.3 | 48.3 |\n|  | Direct | 371.7 | 18.6 |\n|  | Direct contingency | 22.2 | 1.1 |\n|  | Indirect | 12.9 | 0.6 |\n|  | Indirect contingency | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n|  | Mining development | 586.3 | 29.4 |\n|  | Sub-total | 993.2 | 49.7 |\n|  | Closure | 40.0 | 2.0 |\n| Total |  | $\\mathbf{1 , 9 9 7 . 5}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0}$ |\n\nTable 1-9: 2024 PEA Operating Cost Estimate\n\n| Category | LOM Unit Cost <br> (\\$/t milled) | LOM Total Cost <br> (\\$M) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Underground geology | 0.94 | 49.90 |\n| Underground development | 3.84 | 202.82 |\n| Underground production | 13.27 | 701.45 |\n| Underground maintenance | 11.40 | 602.20 |\n| Underground services | 10.72 | 566.56 |\n| Mill production | 10.82 | 571.78 |\n| Mill service | 1.13 | 59.65 |\n| Mill maintenance | - | - |\n| Site administration | 5.96 | 315.11 |\n| Site services | 7.04 | 372.02 |\n| Site services maintenance | 0.32 | 16.99 |\n| Total | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 4 5}$ | $\\mathbf{3 , 4 5 8 . 4 8}$ |The differential value of adding the underground mine and mill optimization on the base scenario where processing production plateaus at $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\" model) has a cumulative free cash flow before tax estimated at C\\$4,552 M. The cumulative free cash flow after tax is $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 3,052 \\mathrm{M}$. At a $5 \\%$ discount rate, the net present value of free cash flows before tax is $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 1,971 \\mathrm{M}$ and of free cash flow after tax is $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 1,187 \\mathrm{M}$. The internal rate of return of the 2024 PEA is $18.3 \\%$ with an 11-year payback period.\n\n# Sensitivity Analysis \n\nA sensitivity analysis of the differential value of underground and mill optimization (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\") was performed considering variations in gold price, exchange rate, operating and capital costs. Flexing based on gold grade processed was excluded because it reflects the same sensitivity as the gold price, given a flat gold price assumption. The undiscounted free cash flow after tax is negative at a gold price of US\\$1,070/oz. The net present value of free cash flow after tax is negative at a gold price of US\\$1,250/oz. The 2024 PEA is most sensitive to changes in the gold price and exchange rate, less sensitive to operating cost changes, and least sensitive to changes in the capital cost assumptions.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.10 Risks And Opportunities\n\nKey risks identified with the 2024 PEA include:\n\n- The limited percentage of Indicated Mineral Resources in the proposed mine plan;\n- Changes to the open pit mining sequence would affect the assumptions in the underground mine plan;\n- Water management and ground stability in proximity to historical underground workings;\n- Reliance on the proposed trucking haulage system to achieve proposed production targets;\n- Geotechnical risks.\n\nOpportunities include:\n\n- Mineralization remains open along the west end of the current deposit, and parallel to the chloritic greenstone unit and the structural splays coming out of it;\n- Upgrading Inferred Mineral Resources to higher confidence categories with additional drilling and supporting studies;\n- Delivering material that meets the low-grade stockpile cut-off to be potentially treated at the end of the proposed mine life.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 1.25.11 Conclusions\n\nUsing the assumptions and parameters detailed for the 2024 PEA, which includes Inferred Mineral Resources in the PEA mine plan, the conceptual economic analysis returns positive economics.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 1.26 Recommendations\n\nTwo work programs are suggested, portions of which can be conducted concurrently.\nThe first work phase consists of surface drilling to potentially support mineral confidence classification upgrades and expand areas of known mineralization that could be potentially mined using underground methods. This phase would consist of about $260,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ of drilling, at an estimated cost of approximately US $\\$ 65 \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThe second work phase is broken into two subareas, which will be advanced concurrently. One will focus on ramp development to provide underground access and sampling points. The estimated cost for the ramp development and associated activities is part of an approved US $\\$ 100 \\mathrm{M}$ budget. The QPs concur with the program aims and budget allocation. The second will consist of engineering studies, and has commenced. Some aspects of the engineering studies will require input from the infill and expansion drill programs envisaged to be completed in Phase 1. The engineering studies will require a budget allocation of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 10.8 \\mathrm{M}$, and this cost estimate was included as part of the 2024 PEA costs."

At that time, the Ontario Government enacted legislation reserving land mineral rights to the Crown and granting leases to individuals or companies seeking to extract minerals. Where mineral rights are privately owned due to granting prior to 1913, they can be sold independently of surface rights, so that surface and mineral rights on the same property can be held by different owners.\n\nThe Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources and Forestry (NDMNRF) has split into two separate regulatory bodies acting under the Ministry of Mines (MINES) and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF). The Canadian Federal Government may also be involved in the mining process where First Nations matters arise, or where the subject lands are federally regulated such as when the lands are classified as navigable bodies of water.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.2.2 Mineral Tenure\n\n## Mining Claim\n\nHistorically, a mining claim was a square or rectangular area of open Crown land (land that belongs to the Province of Ontario) or Crown mineral rights that a licenced prospector marks out with a series of claim posts and blazed lines which could range in size from 16 ha (a one-unit claim) to 256 ha (a 16-unit claim).\n\nThe mining claims in the Sudbury area are administered under Mining Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 14 as well as several regulations thereunder.ANI 43-101 Technical Report\n\n# Mining Lease \n\nA mining claim can be converted into a mining lease. To convert a mining claim into a lease an application letter must be submitted to the Provincial Recording Office's Technical Services Unit any time after the fifth unit of assessment work has been performed (cash payment may be made in lieu of the second to fifth unit of assessment work) on the land and the work has been submitted and approved. After submitting the application letter, the land covered by the mining claims must be surveyed. The applicant may also request that the surface rights be included in the Mining Lease where the surface rights are held by the Crown. Where the surface rights are privately held, the lessee of the mineral rights may need to acquire the surface rights if required for development or production purposes.\nA lease grants its owner title and ownership to the land, permits the extracting and sale of extracted resources, and removes the requirement to perform yearly assessment work.\nTo maintain a lease, rent must be paid annually. A lease expires after 21 years but can be renewed if the lease-holder can demonstrate continuous production of minerals for at least one year since the issuance or if the lease-holder can show that it has taken a reasonable effort to bring the property into production. A mining lease can also be renewed on the basis of contiguity with other mining leases where production has occurred.\nA mining lease cannot be transferred or mortgaged by the lessee without the prior consent of the Ministry of Mines. Transfers require the lessee to submit various documentation and pay a fee.\n\n## Patented Claims\n\nThe owner of freehold lands in Ontario holds a fee-simple real property interest. Historically, the holder of a mining claim interested in removing minerals from the ground could, instead of obtaining a mining lease, apply to the Ministry of Mines to acquire the freehold interest in the subject lands through the granting of a mining patent.\nSuch patents can include surface and mining rights, or may only comprise mining rights. They give the patentee all of the Crown's title to the subject lands and to all mines and minerals relating to such lands, subject to any reservations set out in the patent. Patented claims are subject to annual Ontario mining taxes and, where surface rights are held, Ontario mineral land taxes.\n\nNo regulatory consent is required for the patentee to transfer or mortgage those lands other than Planning Act approval where the transferred lands are adjacent to other lands held by the same party.\n\n## Mining Licence of Occupation\n\nThese mining licences of occupation allow the holder to use the land in the manner specified in each licence, including the right to dig, excavate and remove ores and minerals from and under the land. The Province of Ontario has the right to revoke licences of occupation on 30 days prior notice.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.2.3 Ontario Modernizing The Mining Act Process\n\nInformation in this section was derived from the Ministry of Mines website, and the QP has not independently verified the information.\n\nOntario has fully implemented the third phase of the Ontario government's Modernizing the Mining Act process. This phase:\n\n- Moves Ontario's mining lands administration systems from ground staking and paper map staking to online registration of mining claims\n- Creates an online Mining Land Administration System that enhances client access to Ontario's mining lands data and improves their ability to manage their files online.\n\nOn 10 April, 2018, Ontario converted Ontario's manual system of ground and paper staking, and maintaining unpatented mining claims to an online system. All active, unpatented claims were converted from their legally defined location by claim posts on the ground or by township survey to a cell-based provincial grid. Mining claims are now legally defined by their cell position on the grid and coordinate location in the Mining Land Administration System Map Viewer. These changes bring greater accuracy and certainty to the location of mining claims, greater certainty of rights and interests, as well as flexible management of land assets.\n\nAnnual assessment work requirements remain unchanged, despite new cell sizes being $11 \\%$ to $50 \\%$ larger than the size of traditional claim units. Assessment work requirements are $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 400$ per cell claim and $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 200$ per boundary claim or any claim that is encumbered. Where work has not been completed ahead of the due date, claims forfeit to the Crown.\n\nUnder the Mining Land Administration System, registering a mining claim is now completed by paying a single registration fee of $\\$ 50$ per cell.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.2.4 Surface Rights\n\nSurface rights refer to any right in land that is not a mining right. The process of acquiring surface rights for mining purposes depends on the owner of the rights:\n\n- If the surface rights are owned by the claim holder, then no action is required\n- If the surface rights are owned by the Crown, then the ownership of the surface rights will be granted to the claim holder during the lease application process as requested by the claim holder\n- If the surface rights are privately owned by an individual or company, then an agreement to allow the claim holder to use the land must be made with the surface rights holder. The agreement should outline the compensation given if the land covered by the surface rights sustains any damages.\n\nConfirmation of an agreement with the surface rights owner is required for grant of a mining lease, or an order of the Mining Lands Commissioner indicating that surface rights compensation, if any, has been paid, secured, or settled must be provided.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.2.5 Environmental Considerations\n\nThe Ontario Environmental Assessment Act is the legislation most often applied to environmental aspects of mining projects in Ontario. Mining project components may also be subject to the Federal Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.\n\nProjects that are directly undertaken by a public agency; are undertaken on their behalf to fulfill a public agency responsibility or involve a public agency resource (for example, use of Crown lands, funding from a government agency, or impact on resources under government jurisdiction such as water bodies, fish habitat, timber or Mineral Resources) are required to follow an environmental assessment (EA) process. Both the Provincial and Federal EA acts generally apply. Both EA acts provide opportunities for varying levels of effort for conducting an EA, with the most intensive and longer-term processes required either for those projects that have the greatest potential to cause significant adverse environmental effects, or which are relatively unique, with perhaps the scope of potential impacts unknown.\n\nA minimum amount of six months should be anticipated for completion of an environmental assessment, with a likely need of one year or more from the start of the process through to receipt of approval from the relevant agency.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.2.6 Closure Considerations\n\nAll land affected by mining development activity must be rehabilitated after the activity has finished. A closure plan must be developed and acknowledged by the Ministry of Mines before mine development can begin. The plan outlines how the affected land will be rehabilitated and the costs associated with doing so. A financial guarantee equal to the estimated cost of the rehabilitation work is held in trust by the Ministry of Mines that is included with the submission of a closure plan.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.2.7 First Nations Considerations\n\nSection 35 of the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, recognizes and protects Aboriginal and treaty rights in Canada. The Crown has a legal duty to engage in meaningful consultation whenever it has reason to believe that its decisions or actions might infringe upon recognized aboriginal or treaty rights.\n\nThe Ministry of Mines has the responsibility for coordinating the Crown's consultation efforts on decisions relating to mining and mineral exploration. If the project requires approvals or decisions by other Ministries with mineral development regulatory authority, there will be a coordinated approach to the government's consultation with Aboriginal communities.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.3 Project Ownership\n\nThe Project is wholly-owned by Agnico Eagle.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.4 Mineral Tenure\n\nThe $654 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}$ Project area forms one contiguous group of mining patents, mining leases and cell mining claims in the District of Cochrane, Ontario, with a small group of cell claims in Massicotte Township, Québec.\n\nThe Detour Lake Operations are within the following mining leases and mining patents: LEA-108269, LEA-108893, LEA-109040, LEA-109295, LEA-109361, LEA-109382, LEA109966, LEA-110095, LEA-110096, LEA-110097, LEA-110098, LEA-110100, LEA-110101, LEA-110102, LEA-110103, LEA-110104, LEA-110105, LEA-110107, LEA-110116, PAT5476, PAT-5477, PAT-5478, PAT-5479, PAT-5480, PAT-5481, PAT-5482, PAT-5483, PAT5484, PAT-5485.\n\nA summary of the mineral tenure is provided in Table 4-1 and shown in Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2.\n\nAppendix A contains the details of the individual mineral tenures, including location, area, expiry date and any associated royalties. Detailed location maps are provided with the claims tables in Appendix A.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.4.1 Patented Documents\n\nThe patented parcels of land are the most secure form of land tenure and are subject to an annual mining tax payable to the Crown. The patented lands are described by the legal survey of individual mining claims and surveyed mining locations.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.4.2 Leasehold Documents\n\nThe leasehold mining lands consist of 21-year mining leases issued for mining claims that were legally surveyed as individual mining claims or defined by the perimeter survey of groups of mining claims. Each perimeter survey is given a Certified Legal Manager (CLM) designation to describe the surveyed group of claims. Leaseholders are subject to an annual rental payable to the Crown. The Mining Act (Ontario) contains provisions for the renewal of 21-year mining leases. Applications for renewal are subject to review and consent by the Ministry of Mines.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.4.3 Cell Mining Claims\n\nMining claims are legally defined by their cell position on the grid and coordinate location in the Mining Lands Administration System (MLAS) map viewer. The unpatented mining claims (cell mining claims) held by Agnico Eagle do not confer any right, title, interest or claims in or to the mining claims other than the right to proceed as is in the Mining Act (Ontario).Table 4-1: Mineral Tenure Summary Table\n\n| Description | Units | Area <br> (ha) |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Ontario |  |  |\n| Cell mining claims | 2,213 | 39,677 |\n| Lease documents | 45 | 24,613 |\n| Patent documents | 10 | 594 |\n| Québec |  |  |\n| Claims | 20 | 549 |\n| Total | 2,288 | 65,433 |\n\nDetour Lake Operations Ontario, Canada NI 43-101 Technical ReportFigure 4-1: Mineral Tenure Summary Location Plan\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. Appendix A includes subset figures that more clearly show the individual claim numbers.Figure 4-2: Detour Lake Operations Mining Lease and Mining Patent Location Plan\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. Appendix A includes subset figures that more clearly show the individual claim numbers.Upon registering cell mining claims (cells), Agnico Eagle must perform and file exploration assessment work and apply on those cells assessment work credits to maintain them in good standing. The first unit of assessment work of $\\$ 400$ per 20 ha is required by the second anniversary date of the recording of the cell and an additional unit is required to be performed and filed for each year thereafter. Until a mining lease for the mining claims is issued, Agnico Eagle does not have the right to remove or otherwise dispose of any minerals found in, upon or under the mining claim.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 4.4.4 Claims\n\nA claim in Québec provides the stakeholder with a two-year right to explore within the claim holdings for any mineral substance with exceptions. After the initial two-year period claims can be renewed for an additional two-year term on certain conditions including that sufficient assessment work is performed on the claims or payment is made in lieu.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.5 Surface Rights\n\nAgnico Eagle has 30 leases and 10 patents totaling 18,574.442 ha of surface rights on the Detour Lake Project. The patented lands are subject to a yearly annual mining tax payable to the Crown. The 21-year mining leases are subject to an annual rental payable to the Crown and applications for renewal are subject to review and consent by the Ontario Ministry of Mines.\n\nAgnico Eagle's surface rights are sufficient for all the infrastructure and operation of the mine. The infrastructure included the construction of a 230 kV transmission line, a process plant, various mine site buildings (mine services facility, bulk explosives plant, wash bay, fuel, and lube island, etc.), a permanent camp, and new roads to connect the infrastructure buildings.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.6 Water Rights\n\nAgnico Eagle does not exclusively hold water rights in the region. As part of the ongoing environmental compliance Agnico Eagle is required to capture all site runoff from stockpiles and the open pits. Water taking from groundwater and freshwater sources is regulated by the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks via Permits to Take Water. The Detour Lake Mine has a number of active Permits to Take Water, which are renewed at the required regulatory frequency in order to support activities over the life-of-mine (LOM). Since this water is required to be captured it puts the site water balance in a surplus over the LOM, providing sufficient water to be used for processing in the mill, with the excess being discharged to the environment under the permitted discharge conditions for the operations.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.7 Royalties And Encumbrances\n\nThe Project is subject to the royalties listed in Table 4-2. Claim blocks that are subject to royalties are provided in Appendix A and are shown in Figure 4-3.\nAgnico Eagle has an option to acquire 50\\% of the royalty on the Gowest property at any time up to the date that is one year from the date from which \"commercial production\" commences on the Gowest property.\nPrism Resources Inc. (Prism) is entitled to a 7.5\\% net profit interest on the Aurora and Sunday Lake properties. The Aurora claims cover the Zone 58N deposit.\nThe Detour Lake Operations are not subject to any other back-in rights payments, agreements, or encumbrances.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.8 Permitting Considerations\n\nPermitting considerations for operations are discussed in Section 20.\nExploration activities require water-taking permits to be obtained to provide the necessary water for exploration drilling activities. To date, all such permits have been granted as required.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.9 Environmental Considerations\n\nEnvironmental considerations for operations are discussed in Section 20. Liabilities and closure considerations associated with the current operations are also provided in Section 20.\n\nCurrent exploration liabilities primarily consist of the potential for fuel and lubricant spills, and the risk of fire during the drier months because of the use of heavy equipment.\nThe Exploration Department has an Early Exploration Program Woodland Caribou Mitigation Plan in place. This outlines Agnico Exploration's commitment to minimizing adverse impacts during pre-exploration, active exploration, and post exploration activities.\nExploration staff receive training in bird, wildlife, and SAR recognition, as well as the requirements of current Caribou Habitat legislations and regulations pertaining to 2022 updated caribou habitat classification areas. A daily wildlife survey is conducted, and the exploration staff are committed to reducing the impact of exploration activity footprints.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.10 Social License Considerations\n\nSocial licence considerations for operations are discussed in Section 20.Table 4-2: Royalty Summary Table\n\n| Property | NSR Amount <br> (\\%) | NSR Holder | Buy-out Option |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Blocks A through E | 2 | Franco-Nevada | none |\n| Mine property | 2 | Franco-Nevada | none |\n| Purchased claims (individual) | 2 | Individual prospector | none |\n| Gowest | 1 | Franco-Nevada | $\\$ 750,000$ |\n\nFigure 4-3: Detour Lake Property Area Map Showing Areas with Royalty Payments\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Kirkland Lake Gold, 2020\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 4.11 Comment On Property Description And Location\n\nTo the extent known to the QP, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the Project that have not been discussed in this Report."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 5.1 Accessibility\n\nFrom the town of Cochrane (population of approximately 5,000 residents), the Project is easily accessible by the Detour Lake Mine road, the northern extension of Highway 652. The first 151 km on Highway 652 is paved surface, followed by 34 km of well-maintained chipseal road to the mine site. Road access is available year-round.\n\nAn airstrip built in 2021 provides access by air to the site. The closest major airport to the site is at Timmins, Ontario, approximately 61 km to the southeast.\n\nSite access is controlled by a manned security gate to prevent the general public accessing the active mining areas, and by a security terminal at the aerodrome.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 5.2 Climate\n\nThe climate in the Project area is characterized by cold winters and mild summers.\nThe mean annual temperature is estimated at $0.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, with average daily temperatures ranging from $-18.7^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ in January to $16.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ in July.\n\nThe average total annual precipitation is estimated at 862 mm with approximately 30\\% falling as snow, and the greatest precipitation contribution occurring as rain during June through October.\n\nThe predominant wind direction is from the west.\nMining and exploration activities are conducted year-round.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 5.3 Local Resources And Infrastructure\n\nThe closest settlement to the Project is the Town of Cochrane, Ontario.\nThe region benefits from a strong contractor and supplier base to the mining industry. Skilled labour and suppliers are readily available in Cochrane, Timmins, Kapuskasing, and Iroquois Falls.\n\nAdditional information on site infrastructure is provided in Section 18.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 5.4 Physiography\n\nSite topography is subdued with maximum local relief of approximately 30 m . The elevation ranges from approximately 260-288 metres above sea level. There is a pronounced north/south fluting of the landscape consistent with the general direction of the most recent glaciation in this area.Areas of higher relief are sparsely wooded with jack pine, black and white spruce, balsam fir, trembling aspen, and white birch. Areas that are slightly lower in relief are poorly drained and characterized by muskeg.\n\nThere is very little bedrock outcrop and much of the Project area is overlain by thick accumulations of glacial material that includes till and glaciofluvial material (poorly sorted sand with lenses of gravel).\n\nNumerous small streams linking elliptical lakes and ponds, generally oriented parallel to the pattern of glacial fluting. Numerous small and shallow lakes are found within the Project area, the largest being Sunday Lake, with a surface area of approximately $2.8 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 5.5 Sufficiency Of Surface Rights\n\nThere is sufficient surface area for the open pits, waste rock storage facilities (WRSFs), plant, tailings management area (TMA), associated infrastructure, and other operational requirements for the LOM and mine plan discussed in this Report."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 7.1 Regional Geology\n\nThe regional geology description is summarized from Oliver et al., (2011).\nThe Project is located within the northwestern portion of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, which lies, in turn, within the eastern part of the Wawa-Abitibi sub-province, a Neoarchean granitegreenstone sub province in the southern Superior Province of the Canadian Shield craton. The Abitibi Greenstone Belt consists of east-west-trending synclines of felsic to ultramafic volcanic rocks. Intervening domes are cored by syn-volcanic tonalite and gabbro-diorite rocks and alternate with east-west-trending bands of late tectonic turbiditic and conglomeratic sedimentary rocks. Most of the volcanic and sedimentary strata dip vertically and are commonly bound by abrupt, east-west-trending faults with varied dips.\nThe stratigraphy of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt is subdivided into earlier volcanic-dominated episodes that include the Pacaud assemblage (2770-2736 Ma), the Deloro assemblage (2730-2724 Ma), the Stoughton-Roquemaure assemblage (2723-2720 Ma), the KiddMunro assemblage (2719-2711 Ma), the Tisdale assemblage (2710-2704 Ma), and the Blake River assemblage (2704-2695 Ma). These sequences are unconformably overlain by turbidites and calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of the Caopatina assemblage (ca. 2700 Ma ) in the north and the Porcupine assemblage (2690-2685 Ma) in the south. These units in turn are unconformably overlain by coarse clastic and alkaline volcanic rocks of the Opemisca assemblage (ca. 2692 Ma ) in the north and the Timiskaming assemblage (26762670 Ma ) in the south. A regional geology figure is included as Figure 7-1.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 7.2 Project Geology\n\nIn the Project area, the greenstone-granite architecture is partially aligned and disrupted along a linear, east-west-trending belt that defines the position of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone.\n\nSupracrustal rocks within the Project area consist of a thick sequence of mafic to ultramafic lithologies, which are predominantly volcanic in origin, and are part of the Deloro assemblage. They occur within regional synclinal-anticlinal fold structures traced for over 30 km across the Project and are in structural contact to the south with the younger sediments of the Caopatina assemblage. These rocks are bounded to the north and west by the Opatica basement gneissic rocks. To the east and south, the Deloro assemblage is intruded by several large, weakly foliated granodioritic to tonalitic intrusions which are intersected by numerous local felsic to mafic dykes, sills, and younger regional Proterozoic diabase dykes.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 7.2.1 Lithologies\n\nThe major lithologies in the Project area are summarized in Table 7-1.

SLDZ = Sunday Lake Deformation Zone; MDZ = Massicotte Deformation Zone; LDDZ = Lower Detour Deformation Zone.The Deloro Assemblage, north of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, is sub-divided into the Upper Detour Lake Formation, a volcanic assemblage dominated by tholeiitic basalt (mainly high-Mg massive and high-Fe pillowed flows); and the Lower Detour Lake Formation, an ultramafic-dominant komatiitic and high-Mg tholeiitic volcanic and intrusive assemblage.\n\nWhere the komatiitic lithologies are in contact with the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, they are highly deformed and altered into talc-chlorite schist. The contact is highly mylonitized, mineralized and silicified and hosts a strongly deformed felsic to intermediate dyke-like body known locally as the \"chert marker horizon\".\n\nThe chert marker horizon is not a chert unit, but rather a fine-grained felsic volcaniclastic unit and/or a series of intensely silicified and sulphidized volcanic rocks and intermediate sills and dykes. It occurs between mafic-dominated volcanic rocks of the Upper Detour Formation (hosts hanging wall mineralization) and ultramafic volcanic rocks of the Lower Detour Formation (hosts footwall mineralization).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 7.2.2 Structure\n\nThe major structural feature is the 30 km -long Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, an east-west-trending, steeply north-dipping deformation corridor. The zone marks the northern contact between the Caopatina assemblage sedimentary rocks and the underlying Deloro assemblage volcanic rocks. Mineralization at Detour Lake and West Detour is spatially related to Sunday Lake Deformation Zone structures.\n\nKinematic indicators confirm sinistral-reverse north over south motion along the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone. A regional east-west trending structure, the Massicotte Deformation Zone is recognized several kilometres to the south of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone and extends for over 30 km in strike length. It marks the southern contact between the Caopatina assemblage sedimentary rocks and the underlying Deloro assemblage volcanic rocks.\n\nThe third major structure is the Lower Detour Deformation Zone, a 30 km long, east-westtrending, and steeply south-dipping one that separates Caopatina assemblage sedimentary rocks and the underlying Deloro assemblage volcanic rocks. Zone 58 N occurs immediately south of the Lower Detour Deformation Zone.\n\nThe youngest structures are a series of 120-145trending faults, which are locally intruded by Proterozoic-age diabase dykes.\n\nTwo east-trending synform-antiform pairs are developed in the volcanic assemblage, the North Walter Lake Synform and the Airstrip Antiform (Figure 7-3). These folds are tight, upright, slightly overturned, and south-facing. A later fold set consists of broad open folds that have axial traces striking at approximately $145^{\\circ}$, and plunging $10-35^{\\circ}$ to the northwest. The inter-limb distances of these folds are approximately $8-12 \\mathrm{~km}$.Figure 7-3: Local Structural Setting\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure from Oliver et al., (2011).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 7.2.3 Metamorphism\n\nAll rock units have undergone upper greenschist to lower-grade amphibolite metamorphism.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 7.2.4 Alteration\n\nAll lithological units are hydrothermally altered proximal to major deformation zones.\nStrong secondary biotite is developed in mafic rocks. Talc-actinolite chlorite assemblages formed in ultramafic sills next to the chert marker horizon and across the northern edge of the Detour Lake deposit and through the West Detour deposit. The footwall magnesiumrich komatiitic volcanic rocks show alteration to schistose rocks with a mineral assemblage of chlorite-talc-calcite-tremolite/actinolite-biotite. Silicification may overprint the biotite alteration or occur as an intense pinkish halo with associated potassic feldspar flooding.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 7.2.5 Mineralization\n\nThere are two recognized episodes of gold mineralization at the Detour Lake and West Detour deposits.\n\nThe first episode consists of a wide and generally auriferous sulphide-poor quartz vein stockwork formed in the hanging wall of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone. The sulphidepoor quartz vein stockworks observed in the hanging wall have sub-vertical north or south dips and are parallel to a series of east-west trending high strain zones. These veins form a weak stockwork and are boudinaged and/or folded.\n\nThe second episode is a stage of gold mineralization overprinting the early auriferous stockwork, principally in the hanging wall of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, with a higher sulphide content. The sulphide-rich gold mineralization predominantly fills structural sites in deformed quartz veins, fractures and veins crosscutting the foliation fabric but also in pillow breccias and selvages. The distribution of sulphide-rich mineralization is strongly controlled by the geometry of kinematic orientation (i.e., pyrite and pyrrhotite concentrations have a shallow westerly plunge similar to the plunge of the main flexure zone in the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone at an angle of about $40^{\\circ}$ (in the area of the former Campbell pit), shallowing to approximately $10^{\\circ}$ further to the west).\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 7.3 Deposit Descriptions\n\nThis Report recognizes that the Detour Lake deposit and the West-North Detour deposit, as described in previous technical reports, are a single mineral deposit, and are described as such in the following sub-sections.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 7.3.1 Detour Lake\n\n## Dimensions\n\nMineralization at Detour Lake is hosted within a broad corridor. Mineralization extends from approximately 584,000 E to 593,000 E, 5,540,500 N to 5,542,000 N and 5,500 m elevation to $6,300 \\mathrm{~m}$ elevation. This corresponds to a strike extent of 9.0 km , a width of 1.5 km , and an approximate elevation range of $1,000 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\n## Lithologies\n\nMineralization is hosted within a broad assemblage of mafic volcanic rocks with an overall east-west trend. The deposit has been drill tested along this mineralized corridor for a distance of over 10 km . The bulk of the mineralization within this corridor is concentrated along a highly-strained corridor of a moderate to strong potassic alteration envelope at the contacts between pillowed and massive mafic flows.\n\nLocated at the eastern end of this corridor, within the active Detour Lake open pit, is the Main Zone. The Main Zone was the largest gold-bearing mineralized zone exploited in the period from 1983-1997, and consists of gold mineralization occurring in the Chert Marker Horizon or in quartz and quartz-carbonate vein systems splaying from the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone. Historical quartz zones Q50, Q70, Q100 and Q120 were typical quartz vein arrays splaying off the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone into the hanging wall.\nThe former Campbell open pit was located at the shallowest zone developed along the contact between massive magnesium-rich tholeiitic and pillowed iron-rich tholeiitic volcanic rocks.\n\nWest of section 19,620E, the mineralization mainly straddles the lower massive flow-pillow flow contact and is commonly associated with increased biotite alteration. Mineralization is generally well distributed within this sequence but lithological changes to coarser and massive facies may locally affect mineralization continuity.\n\nFrom sections 16,160E to 17,160E, Placer Dome intersected the QK Zone along a massive flow-pillow flow contact between 600-750 m below surface.\n\nA geology plan is included as Figure 7-4, and geological cross-sections are provided as Figure 7-5 to Figure 7-7.\n\nThe Main Zone mineralization, the focus of previous underground mining, strikes easterly to northeasterly, and has an average dip of $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$. It has a plunge of $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{W}$ near surface, flattening out below the 660 m level. The hanging wall contact is irregular, resulting from diverging quartz vein structures. The footwall contact is more regular and undulates with local dips varying from $30^{\\circ}$ to near vertical. The Quartz Hanging Wall Zones strike at azimuth $080^{\\circ}$, with a vertical to near vertical dip, and a plunge of $45^{\\circ} \\mathrm{W}$ parallel to the Main Zone.Figure 7-4: Deposit Geology Plan\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.

The Quartz Hanging Wall zones, also the subject of historical underground mining, are characterized by discrete groups of steeply-dipping (predominately north) quartz veins. Generally having widths of $3-5 \\mathrm{~m}$, these quartz zones appear to splay off the Chert Marker Horizon, although it is difficult to trace these zones directly back to the chert. Potassic alteration is locally associated with these zones.\n\nThe mineralization hosted in the Main and Quartz Hanging Wall Zones was tested by underground core drilling to a vertical depth of 900 m from surface and approximately 100 m below historical mine workings. The results from this drilling demonstrate that there may be potential to extend this mineralization at depth.\n\nThe footwall Talc Zone is principally located between 590,500 E and 592,000 E (eastern end of the Detour Lake Mine). It is hosted in highly altered (i.e., serpentinized and talcose) ultramafic flows with mineralization concentrated at both the upper contact (Chert Marker Horizon), and lower contact of the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, next to barren volcaniclastics and mafic volcanic rocks. Locally, the mineralization is cut by felsic to intermediate intrusive dykes, ranging in width from $0.3-25 \\mathrm{~m}$. The footwall mineralization commonly contains boudins of quartz veins and felsic as well as intermediate dyke slivers. It is generally intensely sheared, especially in the area adjacent to the contact with the volcaniclastic sediments.\n\nTo the west, mineralization associated with gold zones occurs in a variety of structural settings and several rock types including massive to pillowed tholeiitic basalt flows, variably deformed-altered basaltic to peridotitic komatiite units, cherty tuffs, gabbro and deformed felsic to intermediate dykes. Larger gold zones are subparallel to concordant with stratigraphy (contact related) and smaller quartz and potassic veins occur along splays.\n\nMineralization is commonly associated with increased biotite alteration, shearing, narrow quartz veining and minor pyrite or pyrrhotite. Local zones of strong brecciation with sulphide infilling were recognized, together with minor chalcopyrite, telluride minerals and visible gold. Gold mineralization is associated with a series of sub-vertical to arcuate deformation zones characterized by enhanced strained fabrics, well-defined open-space breccias, and to a lesser degree sheeted shear-hosted veins and extensional veins.\n\nLocated in the hanging wall and analogous with Placer Dome's \"M-Zone\" lies an amphibolechlorite rich ultramafic sheared structure termed chloritic greenstone (CG). Considered to be a key marker horizon, the unit can be traced across the entire deposit. In the western portion of the Detour Lake deposit, the chloritic greenstone is an important mineralized structure containing or juxtaposed to increased gold mineralization. The unit can be quite variable both structurally and mineralogically. It is often observed as a strongly deformed ultramafic comprised predominantly of amphibole and chlorite, contains no apparent primary textures, and can be strongly foliated, folded, jointed, locally crenulated, or even massive. Locally it is strongly biotite-altered and can be intercalated with felsicintermediate intrusions and locally faulted. It often contains highly dismembered quartz veins both within it and along the contacts with intercalated altered felsic to intermediate intrusions. Additional chloritic greenstone units have been noted above and below themineralized chloritic greenstone in the hanging wall, though these appear to more discontinuous and are typically intercalated with the surrounding mafic volcanic units.\n\nIn addition to being located in the hanging wall there is also at least one laterally continuous chloritic greenstone unit close to the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone, often occurring stratigraphically between the 'chert', and the footwall metasedimentary rocks. This footwall chloritic greenstone unit appears to be laterally equivalent to the eastern talc chlorite schist of the former underground mine and has been observed to be intercalated with the footwall metasedimentary units.\n\nApproximately 200 m north of the chloritic greenstone unit, mineralization along the North Walter Lake Trend is developed in a zone of high strain with deformed quartz veins within pillowed to massive mafic volcanic flows. It is hosted by a komatiitic tholeiite mafic volcanic unit and flanked by iron-tholeiitic mafic rocks in the hanging wall and magnesium-tholeiitic mafic rocks in the footwall.\n\n# Mineralization \n\nSeven dominant mineralized domains containing most of the high-grade mineralization at the Detour Lake deposit have been defined and characterized (Figure 7-8 and Figure 7-9). Gold is associated with quartz-carbonate-pyrite-pyrrhotite $\\pm$ tourmaline veins and/or disseminated to very local semi-massive sulphides in hydrothermally-altered wall rocks.\n\nDomain 51 is spatially associated with the Chert Marker Horizon known as the Main Zone (Figure 7-8, Figure 7-9, and Figure 7-10). The Main Zone was the largest gold-bearing mineralized zone initially mined underground during the 1983-1987 period, exploiting a northeast to east-northeast-trending contact area between tholeiitic mafic volcanic rocks to the northwest, and ultramafic-komatiitic mafic rocks to the southeast. The mineralized zone consists of gold mineralization occurring along the Chert Marker Horizon in quartz and quartz-carbonate vein systems splaying from the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone.\n\nIn the East end of the Detour deposit and coincident with the Chert Marker Horizon, various talc zones occur along the footwall. With widths from $4-15 \\mathrm{~m}$, the talc-chlorite mineralization tends to be less continuous along strike than mineralization along the hanging wall side of the Chert Marker Horizon. Gold in the Talc Zone is dominantly associated with pyrite, pyrrhotite, and minor chalcopyrite along foliation planes, narrow discrete shears, or strain zones, and in irregular lenses. The talc zones also contain short, deformed lenses or boudinaged quartz veins. In some cases, mineralization is controlled by well-developed fault structures containing several centimetres of gouge material.\n\nDomain 52 is associated with hanging wall mineralization (Figure 7-8, Figure 7-9, and Figure 7-11) occurring in several different rock units within broad sub-vertical mineralized envelopes, which may split into several sub-vertical domains sub-parallel to the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone.Figure 7-8: Plan View of Mineralized Domains\n![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.Figure 7-9: Long-section View of Mineralized Domains\n![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.Figure 7-10: General Lithological Cross-Section of Domain 51\n![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. CG = chloritic greenstone; FMV = footwall massive volcanic rocks; MF = mafic flow; PF = pillow flow.Figure 7-11: General Lithological Cross-Section of Domain 52\n![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. CG = chloritic greenstone; FMV = footwall massive volcanic rocks; MF = mafic flow; PF = pillow flow.The main underground vein corridors mined historically consisted of the Q zones (Q50Q120), which splay off the northwestern side of the Chert Marker Horizon, and comprise steeply-dipping, parallel cm-to-tens-of-cm-wide quartz-sulphide veins, and veinlets in sheeted zones locally $>10 \\mathrm{~m}$ wide. Mineralization is commonly associated with increased biotite alteration, shearing, narrow quartz veining and minor pyrite or pyrrhotite. Local zones of strong brecciation with sulphide infilling have also been recognized, along with minor chalcopyrite, telluride minerals and visible gold. Gold mineralization is associated with a series of sub-vertical to arcuate deformation zones characterized by enhanced strained fabrics, well-defined open-space breccias, and to a lesser degree sheeted shear-hosted veins and extensional veins.\n\nFurther to the west lies the \"QK Zone\" as denoted by Placer Dome. This mineralization is associated with narrow parallel to sub-parallel quartz veins, quartz boudins and sulphiderich veins/breccias with adjacent silicification and potassic alteration envelopes.\n\nFurther to the north and hanging wall to the Q-zones, Domain 53 is spatially associated with highly-strained corridors at the contacts between pillowed and massive mafic flows encompassing higher grade mineralized zones (Figure 7-8, Figure 7-9, and Figure 7-12). These broad zones contain variable amounts of quartz and pyrite, and are controlled mainly by east-west trending, moderately north-dipping folds and shear structures which plunge at a shallow angle to the west.\n\nIdentified as \"M Zone\" by Placer Dome, Domain 55 encompasses high-grade areas towards the west end of the deposit, mostly following the west extension of the chloritic greenstone unit (Figure 7-8, Figure 7-9, and Figure 7-13). Spatially, Domain 55 lies approximately 400500 m north of the Chert Marker Horizon and is a westerly-trending gold system that is spatially associated with the margins of the chloritic greenstone unit.\n\nDomain 54 is located west of Domain 55 and appears separated by a steeply dipping westnorthwest to east-southeast-oriented brittle fault system interpreted to have potentially 100-150 m of offset (Figure 7-8, Figure 7-9, and Figure 7-14). Investigations are currently underway to substantiate and further investigate the brittle structure. Both of these amphibole-chlorite schist stratigraphic horizons and associated gold mineralization were traced by drilling for approximately 5 km . The footwall and hanging wall sequence of the chlorite schist is variably biotite altered with abundant fractures, with a well-defined foliation which contains local quartz veining with associated pyrite, pyrrhotite and rarely, chalcopyrite. The mineralized zones appear lensoidal and plunge $20^{\\circ}$ west. Mineralized lenses vary from $5-50 \\mathrm{~m}$ in true width.\n\nDomain 56 has similar characteristics to Domain 53, encompassing high-grade mineralized zones within partially to highly-strained corridors at the contacts between pillowed and massive mafic rocks (Figure 7-8, Figure 7-9, and Figure 7-15). They appear to be semiparallel to the chloritic greenstone, and are predominantly narrow east-west subvertical to $65^{\\circ}$ north-northwest-dipping structures.Figure 7-12: General Lithological Cross-Section of Domain 53\n![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.

Gold mineralization is concentrated within potassic-altered mafic volcanic units containing relatively weak quartz vein stockwork with low pyrite and pyrrhotite content exhibiting moderate to strong shearing.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 7.3.2 Zone 58N\n\n## Dimensions\n\nThe Zone 58N mineralized system has been intersected over an east-west strike length of 450 m , from surface to a depth of 800 m , and the mineralized system remains open along strike and at depth. The mineralization extends from approximately 595,300E to 595,750E and $5,533,700 \\mathrm{~N}$ to $5,533,800 \\mathrm{~N}$ (UTM coordinates). The width of the mineralization is variable, ranging from 4 m to $>100 \\mathrm{~m}$ at the centre of the deposit. Infill drilling has demonstrated that the geology and mineralization dip subvertically at $75^{\\circ}$ to the south.\n\n## Lithologies\n\nGold mineralization in Zone 58N is within the southern portion of a feldspar porphyry intrusion, and characterized by intense brittle deformation and stockworks of quartz $\\pm$ carbonate $\\pm$ tourmaline veins with strong biotite-sericite-silica alteration. The thickness of the feldspar porphyry host rock can be $>100 \\mathrm{~m}$ and on average, mineralized lenses are 30 m wide. The feldspar porphyry intrusion narrows to the east and west near surface. Gold mineralization within Zone 58N is hosted by a swarm of plagioclase-phyric tonalitic dykes that intrude mafic rocks of the Deloro assemblage.\n\nThe geometry of host dykes is controlled by a large ( $\\sim 1,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ in diameter) cylindricallyshaped intermediate equigranular intrusion, resulting in emplacement at a slightly oblique angle to the strike of regional stratigraphy. The dyke rocks, and associated mineralization, reach a maximum width of 150 m near the southwestern portion of the intermediate intrusion, and taper along strike.\n\n## Mineralization\n\nVisible gold is often present and occurs within coarse pyrite or as free gold within quartz. Sulphide mineralization associated with gold ranges from $0.5-5 \\%$ pyrite with minor chalcopyrite, bismuth-tellurides, molybdenite and scheelite. Gold is found within and at the margins of quartz $\\pm$ tourmaline $\\pm$ carbonate stockwork-type veins that infill areas of brittle deformation. Visible gold occurs in nearly every drill hole that intersects mineralization and is also present as micro-inclusions within pyrite grains, or intergrown with bismuthtellurides.\n\nA simplified cross-section showing the mineralized zones is provided as Figure 7-17.Figure 7-16: General Lithological Cross-Section of Domain 57\n![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.

The mineralization extends from approximately 595,200E to 595,775E and 5,533,700N to 5,533,775N (UTM coordinates). Mineralized intervals in the 75 Zone are 15 m wide and up to 9 m locally.\n\n## Lithologies\n\nZone 75 mineralization is localized to the stratigraphic contact of high-Mg and high-Fe tholeiitic mafic units. It is hosted by mylonitized and highly silicified rocks that have been subjected to chlorite, biotite, and sericite alteration, which occasionally results in a banded chert-like appearance. Zone 75 dips at approximately $70^{\\circ}$ south.\n\n## Mineralization\n\nWhen in close spatial proximity to Zone 58 N , the mineralization within Zone 75 is much stronger and gold grades typically increase significantly. At depth when the lateral distance between Zone 58 N and Zone 75 increases to $>50 \\mathrm{~m}$, mineralization dramatically decreases in terms of both sulphide and gold content.\n\nThe sulphide content of Zone 75 is much higher than Zone 58N, reaching up to 20\\% pyrite with lesser associated pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite. Visible gold is rarely identified. Mineralized intervals are typically $1-5 \\mathrm{~m}$ wide, and can reach as much as 9 m wide when in contact with feldspar porphyry dyke rocks.\n\nThe simplified cross-section provided as Figure 7-17 includes Zone 75."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 8.1 Deposit Model\n\nThe Detour Lake deposit is considered to be an example of orogenic greenstone-hosted hydrothermal lode gold deposits.\n\nGreenstone-hosted hydrothermal lode gold deposits are typical of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, and in particular the gold deposits found along the Destor-Porcupine Fault Zone from Timmins, Ontario through to Destor, Québec. These deposit types are found in greenstone belts around the world and are responsible for a large proportion of past world gold production, including most of the Canadian gold production.\n\nThe majority of Archean orogenic greenstone-hosted lode gold deposits occur within volcano-plutonic domains, which are typically distributed along crustal-scale fault zones occurring along or in close proximity to terrane or sub-province boundaries (Card et al., 1989). Elongate belts of metavolcanic and some metasedimentary rocks containing subsidiary amounts of ultramafic to felsic intrusive rocks typically dominate these domains. The intrusive rocks will have typically been emplaced in multiple pulses throughout the geologic evolution of the area. Metamorphism within the belts is generally greenschist to lower amphibolite facies. The structure of the gold districts is characterized by the presence of multiple generations of structural fabrics indicating the presence of several periods of deformation.\n\nThe deposit model for the $58,58 \\mathrm{~N}$, and 75 Zones is not firmly established. These mineralized lenses share characteristics with both syenite-associated oxidized intrusionrelated deposits of the Kirkland Lake area (Robert, 2001) and the Sigma-Lamaque deposits of the southern Abitibi (Robert and Brown, 1986a, 1986b), the latter of which are thought to be associated with hydrothermal lode gold deposits.\n\nSyenite-associated intrusion-related gold deposits are distally related to major fault zones, and in association with preserved slivers of Temiskaming-like conglomerate rocks. The deposits consist of stockworks of gold-rich veins and zoned alteration and can be found within or at the margins of composite intrusive stocks, satellite dykes and sills, and along secondary faults and lithological contacts away from the intrusions. Ore bodies in these different locations are interpreted to represent proximal to distal components of large magmatic-hydrothermal systems centered on, and possibly genetically sourced from, composite intrusive stocks. These intrusions, and associated mineralization, are contemporaneous with the deposition of Temiskaming-like rocks and usually post-date major D1 regional deformation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 8.2 Comment On Deposit Types\n\nThe QP is of the opinion that exploration programs that use a greenstone-hosted hydrothermal lode gold deposit or a syenite-associated intrusion-related gold deposit model are applicable to the Project area."

Areas investigated (refer to Figure 9-1) included:\n\n- Lower Detour: examining the areas west and east of the 58 N gold mineralization proximal to the Lower Detour Deformation Zone and coincident with induced polarization (IP) chargeability/resistivity highs and a low magnetic signature associated with mineralized intermediate felsic porphyry and felsic intrusive rocks;\n- West Massicotte: examining areas co-incident with multiple IP conductors on a modhigh magnetic zone at the northeast limb of the West Massicotte Fold Zone and electromagnetic (EM)-IP conductors on a low-moderate magnetic zone associated with felsic-intermediate intrusive rocks along the Massicotte Deformation Zone;\n- East Detour: examining areas east of the Detour Lake deposit along the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone;\n- TMA Cell 2 (Central Sedimentary Belt): exploring for potential thrust faults below the Caopatina Sediments where the mafic rocks could be thrusted upwards into the sedimentary basin;\n- West McAlpine: investigating structural corridors located to the west and north along the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone and the North Walter Lake Trend.Figure 9-1: Compilation Geology Map Showing Exploration Sectors\n![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 9.3 Geochemical Surveys\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 9.3.1 Soil\n\nSoil sampling was conducted by Detour Gold in the period 2010-2011, at $50 \\times 400 \\mathrm{~m}$ line spacing, with samples taken from $10-25 \\mathrm{~cm}$ depth. This program identified a goldmineralized corridor of about 30 km extent along the Lower Detour Deformation Zone (Figure 9-2). Data were used in exploration targeting in conjunction with ground geophysical data.\n\nA trial amplified geochemical imaging soil gas survey was conducted by Detour Gold in 2017, with a total of 33 samples collected. Results indicated a positive correlation to known mineralization in the West Detour area. In the area over barren intrusive rocks no elevated response was identified. Assay results from the soil gas survey indicated that only nine of the 56 elements in the multi-element suite were above detection limit and had suitable quality control measures. However, those nine elements generally had very low values and were not considered to be reliable vectors to mineralization.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 9.3.2 Channel\n\nChannel and chip sampling, consisting of 45 samples, were completed during 2012-2013. Results returned six samples above the detection limit of 0.05 ppb Au .\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 9.3.3 Trench\n\nIn 2014 and 2016, 13 trenches were completed in outcrop within the planned TMA area. A total of 151 channel samples were submitted for assay. The trenches encountered minor gold mineralization associated with the Sunday Lake tonalite-granodiorite intrusion, and hosted in shear zones up to several metres in width that locally exploit northeast-trending mafic-intrusive contacts.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 9.4 Geophysical Surveys\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 9.4.1 Airborne\n\nCGG Canada Services Ltd. completed a 13,816 line-km helicopter-borne MIDAS high resolution magnetic survey in 2015 over the entire Project area on behalf of Detour Gold. The survey was flown on 50 m line spacing at an elevation of approximately 30 m . The survey produced high quality total magnetic intensity and gradient data for additional processing. Results were used to map the subsurface geology, and to generate Projectscale and local-scale structural interpretations to help define drill targets.\n\nA map showing the airborne geophysical response in the Project area is provided as Figure 9-3.Figure 9-2: Sunday Lake Soil Sampling Compilation Map\n![img-23.jpeg](img-23.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Detour Gold, 2011.Figure 9-3: Airborne Geophysical Map\n![img-24.jpeg](img-24.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Kirkland Lake Gold, 2020.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 9.4.2 Ground\n\nGround geophysical surveys were completed in efforts to uncover insights into geological structure, lithology, and potential mineralogical trends throughout the Project area.\n\nCompleted geophysical surveys are summarized in Table 9-1 and the outlines of the various surveys are shown in Figure 9-4. Historical IP data were conducted with different arrays including dipole-dipole, gradient and pole dipole.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 9.5 Petrology, Mineralogy, And Research Studies\n\nIn 2016, samples were collected from Zone 58N area to determine the age of the various lithologies and timing of the gold mineralization. Uranium-lead analysis (ID-TIMS method) of magmatic zircons from the tonalitic host rock indicated an age of $2694.5 \\pm 1.5 \\mathrm{Ma}$. Uranium-lead analysis (LA-ICP-MS method) of hydrothermal titanites associated with Zone 58N mineralization indicates an age of $2680 \\pm 12 \\mathrm{Ma}$. These geochronology results indicate that Zone 58N mineralization occurred slightly later than at the Detour Lake deposit, which occurred at 2697 Ma (Oliver et al., 2011). Based on those results, it is likely that multiple metallogenic events occurred on these two major deformation zones, which is encouraging for the exploration potential of the area.\n\nIn 2017, work done by the Geological Survey of Canada, as part of the ongoing TGI 5 project, was published in a preliminary progress report:\n\n- Castonguay, S., Dube, B., Mercier-Langevin, P., and Wodicka, N., 2018: Nature and Significance of Deformation Zones on Gold Mineralization in the Detour Lake Area: Implications for Exploration in Ontario and Québec.\n\nGeochemical and geochronological sampling was completed by the progress report authors, but no results of this work had been published at the Report effective date.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 9.6 Exploration Potential\n\nExploration potential remains in the area where mineral resources are estimated. The Detour Lake deposit remains open at depth and to the west.\n\nAgnico Eagle intends to continue step-out and infill drilling in the vicinity of the current resource pit shell and targeting areas of higher grade proximal to underground mineral resources. Infill drilling is also planned to improve understanding related to known mineralization and potentially supporting Mineral Resource category upgrades for the mineralization considered potentially amenable to underground mining methods.Table 9-1: Ground Geophysical Surveys\n\n| Year | Company/Contractor | Survey | Comment |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 2011-2012 | Detour Gold | 383 line-km phase domain dipole-dipole IP; lines 200 m apart, | Outlined a number of geophysical anomalies tested by regional drilling programs with the 58, 75 zones identified in these campaigns. |\n| 2013 | Detour Gold | 67 line-km of time domain IP geophysical surveys; 51 linekm of gradient array and 5 line-km of sectional IP conducted in the Lower Detour area; 16 line-km of gradient array and 3 line-km of sectional IP completed in the Sunday Lake area | Outlined several anomalies with follow up completed by core drilling programs in 2013 to 2015.

The database does not have a complete record of all the historical drilling. Core drilling completed on the Project (including 58N) within the database totals $8,975$ drill holes $(2,521,852 \\mathrm{~m})$ including 17 wedge holes. Figure 10-1 shows the collar locations.\n\nDrilling and assaying that supports the Mineral Resource estimate for the Detour Lake deposit was completed by Placer Dome, Trade Winds, Pelangio, and Detour Gold from 1974-2016 (Table 10-2). Within the immediate area of the Mineral Resource estimate, there is a total of 6,519 core drill holes ( $1,128,965.7 \\mathrm{~m}$ ). Drill collar locations for those drill holes are shown in Figure 10-1.\n\nDrilling and assaying that supports the Mineral Resource estimate for the West-North Detour deposit was completed from 1996-2021 by Placer Dome, Trade Winds, Pelangio, Detour Gold, Kirkland Lake Gold, and Agnico Eagle (Table 10-2).

This information is used in support of the current Mineral Resource estimates.\n\nBoth underground and surface core drilled by Amoco and Placer Dome between 19741999 was handled and logged at a facility located at the Detour Lake Mine site.\n\nStandard procedures for logging were not well documented and varied considerably between programs. Logging prior to 1980 was conducted by employees or contractors working for Amoco, Campbell, or Placer. Logging after 1987 was conducted mainly by personnel working for the Detour Lake Mine geology department or Placer's exploration department.\n\nThe earlier logs by Amoco and Campbell appear to have been compiled as handwritten logs, which were sometimes re-typed with a mechanical typewriter and the later ones with various computer logging programs. The majority of logs were conducted with a logging program implemented in the early 1980s by the Detour Lake Mine geology department. Most of the logs compiled by Placer's exploration department were compiled using an inhouse program referred to as Geology, and logs from the Pelangio drill programs were initially recorded as hard-copy logs or in Excel spreadsheets. All of the data were eventually compiled to a Gemcom database.\n\nHistoric coding of lithology, structure and mineralization appear to have varied with time. Logging by Amoco and Campbell was done using a generic system similar to that found on government maps. Most of the later logging by Placer Dome was done with a revised system, which contained rock names, and codes, which were standardized and were specific to the deposit.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.3.2 Pelangio\n\nPelangio drilling tested the Detour Lake and North Pit areas.\nCore was logged at a facility located at the Detour Lake Mine site between 2004-2005. All intervals designated for sampling were assigned and tagged by a geologist that took rock type and geology into consideration.\n\nMost routine sampling was on 1 m widths, but narrowed locally to accommodate geological and mineralized zone boundaries. The minimum width was 0.50 m .\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.3.3 Trade Winds\n\nDrilling completed by Trade Winds was focused on the West Detour and North Pit areas.\nCore was marked at 1 m intervals, and driller measurement block corrections undertaken. Logging used the same pre-set terminology and codes as the Placer Dome programs.Geotechnical logging including core recovery, rock quality designation (RQD) and magnetic susceptibility readings (hand held unit) were collected and recorded in Excel spreadsheets. Core was photographed dry.\n\nAll of the above procedures were monitored and performed on site under direct geological supervision of a qualified geologist.\n\nCore recovery averaged $98.9 \\%$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.3.4 Detour Gold\n\nA geological legend was progressively developed for the Project area incorporating advances in understanding of the regional and local geology, and the deposit-scale geology, structure, alteration, and mineralization.\n\nLogging of RC chips was completed at the drill rig. The basic geological log included: primary lithology; alteration; mineralization; degree of oxidation; sample quality; depth of water inflow (estimation of rates); sample moisture content; veining; texture; fabric; presence of key minerals; sulphide grain size (from grain size chart). Areas of slow or hard drilling were marked onto the drill logs for geotechnical purposes. Software by acQuire Technology Solutions Pty Ltd (acQuire) was used to record observations made on percussion chips into touch screen and laptop computers.\n\nDrill core was placed into wooden core trays at the drill, with depths of each run marked on wooden blocks and inserted into the trays by the drill crew. These trays were delivered to the Exploration Department facility on site. Core was fitted together in the box and rolled to foliation or to the bottom line to designate the axis along which to cut the core. In each campaign, a single side of the core was consistently sampled. The portion to be saved was fitted back into the core box to be kept as a permanent record. All logging and marking of samples were done by Detour Gold's geologists. Photography, recovery, fractures, and rock strength measurements were carried out by geotechnicians under the supervision of geologists.\n\nLithology was logged on a variable interval basis with intervals determined from combinations of rock type, alteration, structure, and mineralization. Geological logging was performed using and collected using a Microsoft Access database developed for Detour Gold. The data were transferred into various database systems depending on desired end usage of the data.\n\nLithology was logged based on the geological unit, with subdivisions created based on alteration and mineralization.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.3.5 Kirkland Lake Gold\n\nDrilling completed by Kirkland Lake Gold during 2020-2022 was primarily focused on the West Detour area.\n\nAll drill core handling was done on site with the logging and sampling processes conducted by employees and contractors of Kirkland Lake Gold. Information was collected using aDHLogger database (June 2020 drilling onward). Drill core was placed into wooden trays at the drill with depths of each run marked on wooden blocks and inserted into trays by the drill crew. These trays were delivered to the exploration core logging facility on site by the drill crew.\n\nAll geotechnical, geological, and sampling data were collected and (in the case of samples) marked by Kirkland Lake Gold geologists. All data entry was done on individual local databases capable of synchronizing with a Central DHLogger/Fusion database managed by Kirkland Lake Gold database geologists. These local databases are synchronized daily.\n\nThe starting and ending depth, and corresponding box number for each box was entered into the core index sheet and used to print box tags. The RQD was recorded, as were the core recovery and core competency percentages, and the natural fracture frequency. Drill hole tab and collar information was added by the geologist including hole type, hole size, drill location, casing, coordinates, planned azimuth, planned dip, contractor, type of drilling, casing status, wedges, extension, survey instrument, cemented/plugged, abandoned hole, flagged hole and drilling start date.\n\nGeological logging, including overburden, lithologies, alteration, mineralization, structure, deformation, and veining, was systematically recorded in DHLogger and uploaded into the Fusion database. Lithologies were logged as major and minor units. A minor unit was classified as between $0.1-1 \\mathrm{~m}$ in core width and had no relation or potential for gold mineralization. Any visible gold identified by the logger was flagged and the interval was noted in the hole flags section. Veining was recorded as individual veins and as veining percentages. Alteration, sulphide, and deformation were a continuous log within the major lithology. Structures were logged as points and intervals, and logging described the type of fabric, the angle to the core axis, and the intensity.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.3.6 Agnico Eagle\n\nAgnico Eagle used the same policies and procedures with respect to core handling that were used by Kirkland Lake Gold.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.4 Recovery\n\nIn general, core recovery exceeds $90 \\%$ with losses generally occurring within overburden, the first few metres of bedrock, or when drilling through a fault zone.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.5 Collar Surveys\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.5.1 Legacy\n\nLegacy drilling completed by Amoco, Campbell Red Lake and Placer Dome was used for grade estimation in 2020 for Detour Lake, in 2013 for West Detour and in 2016 for the North Pit area.\n\nThe following information on the legacy collar surveys is abstracted from Kallio (2006).Most of the drill holes on surface were originally spotted using measurements from cut grids.\nHoles drilled by Amoco were located using an east-west-trending grid, installed in the mid1970s, which used imperial measurements. Drill holes completed by Campbell, Placer Dome, and Pelangio were located using a true north grid, which was established around 1981.\n\nThe hole locations for the 2005 Pelangio drill program were determined by measurements from a short baseline that was installed to the west of the former open pit by Sutcliffe Rody Quesnel of Timmins, Ontario, and the drill holes for the 2006 program were located by surveying in with a differential global positioning system (DGPS).\nThe initial elevations for most legacy drill hole collars were assumed to be derived from a combination of topographic maps and data points from previous drill holes or nearby survey stations. The azimuths were probably determined by measurements from pickets or a compass. Azimuths for the Pelangio drilling were determined by turning off angles from the new baseline using an optical square prism.\n\nThe reliability of collar locations for most historic surface drill holes is unknown as many were drilled from areas within, or immediately surrounding, the former pit on lands, which have now been reclaimed. Most of the available information was obtained from drill log headers. The only original survey data that have been located were for some selected holes of the 38, 38W and the 464 series. Holes from the 38 and 38 W series were surveyed by H. Sutcliffe and holes from the 464 series by General Exploration Services of Timmins, Ontario.\n\nThe initial position and azimuth of most underground holes were typically determined using measurements from underground survey stations and reference points. The measurements were usually done by a geologist or diamond drill foreman, but were sometimes surveyed in by the mine surveyors in situations requiring greater accuracy. Initial collar elevations are assumed to have been determined using engineering plans and starting dips set with a degree rule. Holes not surveyed during the initial setup were often picked up by the mine survey department after completion of the drill hole.\n\nData from surveying of underground holes was located on a combination of drill log headers, a survey ledger book and survey sheets prepared by the Detour Lake Mine survey department. Data for several holes was also recorded in computer files generated with the MINSURV program, a multi-purpose software application instituted by the mine survey department in the early 1990s to store and manipulate survey data. Kallio (2006) reviewed the survey sheets and indicated that they contained information from holes drilled by Placer Dome between surface and the 15 level and that approximately $50 \\%$ of holes were represented.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.5.2 Trade Winds/Detour Gold\n\nDetour Gold survey protocols included that foresights and backsights were laid out by Talbot Surveys Ltd. (Talbot) using a DGPS Topcon GR3 instrument with a Nikon total station instrument. The UTM 1983 North American Datum (NAD83) system was used to recordposition data. Survey data were converted to the mine grid for compatibility with the historical data.\n\nOccasionally, when Talbot staff were unavailable, hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units or compass and chain methods were used to locate collar pickets, which were inadvertently moved or destroyed. For exploration and reconnaissance drilling programs, drill hole collars were surveyed using GPS units.\n\nTrade Winds used the Detour Gold protocols from 2009 onward. Once the drill rig was positioned on the planned location, it was lined up using a Reflex GPS casing alignment instrument working within $\\pm 0.2-0.5^{\\circ}$ accuracy. After a drill hole was completed and the rig moved off drill site, the casing was covered with a steel cap and a wooden marker was placed next to the casing with the hole collar identification. Talbot returned to site approximately every second week and surveyed the casing locations, as well as the azimuth and inclination of the holes drilled during this period. Measurements were taken at the top of the casing, which usually extended out for about 15 cm above the ground surface.\n\nThe 2016 infill drilling of the North pit and Detour West pit used compass and chain methods to locate collar pickets. Final hole locations for the North pit were surveyed by Labelle Surveys, Timmins, Ontario. The two drill holes completed in 2017 were not surveyed.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.5.3 Kirkland Lake Gold\n\nKirkland Lake Gold used a Reflex TN14 Gyrocompass for spotting and aligning drill holes during the 2020 drill program. Drill hole collar surveys were systematically surveyed by Talbot using a DGPS Topcon GR3 instrument with a Nikon total station instrument.\n\nSome select collars were also surveyed by Kirkland Lake Gold staff using a DGPS Trimble SPS986 premium precise rover.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.5.4 Agnico Eagle\n\nAgnico Eagle used a Trimble SPS986 GNSS Rover as the primary collar survey tool with quality control checks being completed by Talbot using a DGPS Topcon GR3 instrument with a Nikon total station instrument.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.6 Downhole Surveys\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.6.1 Legacy\n\nDown-hole survey procedures varied with time and are not well documented. The following is abstracted from Kallio (2006).\nMost of the early programs by Amoco and Campbell appear to have been surveyed with acid tests and with some limited Tropari testing. Spacing of the tests varies between 3060 m , but occasionally surveys may be as much as 120 m apart.\n\nDownhole surveying during later drilling by the Detour Lake Mine geology department was often completed using a combination of Tropari and acid tests, which were taken by thediamond drillers. Spacing between consecutive tests varied from 30-60 m, but locally could be as much as 200 m between measurements. Most drill holes $<60 \\mathrm{~m}$, such as those from the 56 Lv to 66 Lv series were typically only surveyed with a single acid test at the bottom of the hole.\n\nDownhole surveying conducted by Placer's exploration department was often conducted using a combination of Sperry Sun and acid testing. Spacing between acid or Sperry Sun tests typically varied between 50-75 m. Spacing between consecutive Tropari tests was as much as 200 m .\n\nDownhole surveying by Pelangio was completed using a Flexit SmartTool supplied by Fordia of Val-d'Or, Quebec. Drillers, who had been trained by the supplier, took all tests. Testing in 2005 was at 30 m intervals and testing in 2006 at 3 m intervals down the length of the hole. All tests were checked for magnetic interference.\n\nAvailable data from past downhole surveying were in the form of drill log headers or survey ledgers prepared by past project operators.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.6.2 Trade Winds/Detour Gold\n\nDownhole surveying of Trade Winds' drill holes was also done by a Flexit SmartTool whereby azimuth and dip reading were collected every 3 m down hole by the drillers. Trade Winds removed irregular readings that were caused by magnetic interference.\n\nFor the Detour Gold programs, Reflex EZ-Shot (EZ-Shot) and Reflex Maxibor II (Maxibor) instrumentation were used. The primary survey was completed at 30-60 m intervals using an EZ-Shot instrument. Immediately after the drill hole was completed, surveys of the direction and dip changes were carried out using a Reflex Maxibor II instrument. The instrument was lowered down the hole and readings taken every 3 m on the way back up. In 2010, Detour Gold discontinued the use of the Maxibor check surveys because the results were comparable with those obtained using the EZ-Shot.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.6.3 Kirkland Lake Gold\n\nKirkland Lake Gold used a Reflex EZ Trac and Reflex Gyro Sprint-IQ instrument for down hole surveys during its 2020 exploration program. The primary survey was completed at 10 m below casing followed by surveys completed at 50 m intervals. A final continuous survey was completed at the end of each drill hole.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 10.6.4 Agnico Eagle\n\nAgnico Eagle used the same policies and procedures with respect to down hole surveys as were used by Kirkland Lake Gold.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.7 Sample Length/True Thickness\n\nFor surface drilling programs testing the Detour Lake deposit, the true width is estimated to be $65-85 \\%$ of the drilled length. Actual true width is dependent of the inclination and direction of the hole when intercepting the mineralized zone.\n\nFor historic underground drilling programs at the Detour Lake and West Detour deposits, drilling was done in \"fans\" and true thickness of mineralization is variable from approximately $60-85 \\%$ of drilled thickness.\n\nExamples of the orientation of the drilling to the mineralization are provided in the crosssections in Section 7.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.8 Grade Control\n\nGrade control at the Detour Lake Mine completed using RC drilling, conducted at 10 m spacing (north-south) on 20 m sections. Holes are drilled at an azimuth of $180^{\\circ}$ (due south), at $-60^{\\circ}$ inclination. Drill hole lengths are designed to intercept either two or three full benches, thus are typically 28 m or 42 m long, unless adjusted for unusual bench heights. The occasional area can be drilled to 56 m depth to accommodate drill access near old underground workings or other circumstances.\n\nAll drill hole locations are surveyed. Any RC hole over three benches in length has a gyroscopic survey performed for hole deviation.\n\nA grade control testing program consisting of 47 drill holes on a 20 m section spacing was carried out on the West Detour deposit in 2016 to test the grade estimation model and define the impact of tighter spaced drilling on the modelled ore zones. This drilling is also not used in estimation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.9 Twin Hole Drilling\n\nIn 2016, an infill drilling program of 5,353 m in 44 holes (excluding one hole abandoned due to excessive deviation) was carried out on a $20 \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m}$ spacing to simulate grade control and evaluate the resource block model current at the time. The grade control drilling targeted a geologically complex ore domain area of the West Detour pit in order to validate modelling assumptions and determine if an alternate modelling methodology would be preferable. Composites simulating ore zones were created from each drill hole. Results were compared with the grade interpolation models that intersected the drill hole traces, and were considered to validate the resource estimate current at the time.\n\nThis program also twinned nine holes from Trade Winds and one hole from the 2012 Detour Gold drilling program. The drilling covered an area of 120 m (Sections 15,780E to 15,900E) by 150 m (20,375N to 20,525N), from bedrock surface to a depth of approximately 100 m (6,270EL to 6,170EL).The results from the twinned-hole test indicated that over the entire mineralized intervals the correlation was positive, although results varied considerably over individual intervals (both length of mineralized zones and gold grade) as expected due to the high nugget effect. There did not appear to be a grade bias in the area tested.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.10 Drilling Since Database Close-Out Date\n\nDrilling completed at the Detour Lake Operation after the 16 October, 2023 database closeout to 31 March, 2024 included 65 core holes for $82,055 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThe additional drill holes were drilled primarily west of the underground mineable shape outlines used for the preliminary economic assessment discussed in Section 24.\n\nIn the QP's opinion, the new drilling will have no material impact on the Mineral Resources in this area.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 10.11 Comments On Drilling\n\nIn the opinion of the QP, the quantity and quality of the logged geological data, collar, and downhole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill programs are sufficient to support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation and mine planning as follows:\n\n- Core and RC logging meets industry standards for gold exploration at the time the logging was conducted;\n- Collar surveys have been performed using industry standard instrumentation at the time the survey was conducted;\n- Downhole surveys were performed using industry standard instrumentation at the time the survey was conducted;\n- Recovery data from core drill programs are acceptable;\n- Drill orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralization style and the orientation of mineralization for the bulk of the deposit areas.\n\nDrilling has generally been done at regularly-spaced intervals and is considered representative of the deposits. Drilling was not specifically targeted to the high-grade portions of the deposits, rather, a relatively consistent drill spacing was completed."

General procedures were similar for both underground and surface drill core and involved sampling of most of the drill hole. Core samples were typically collected on standard 5 -ft ( 1.52 m ) intervals with some being narrowed to as little as $1-\\mathrm{ft}(0.3 \\mathrm{~m})$, when better grades were expected. In most cases the collection of samples was done by splitting and extracting $1 / 2$ of the core with a mechanical splitter. Most samples with visible gold were whole-core sampled and indicated by a notation of \"w/c\" in the log. Samples were packed in bags containing numbered tags and transported to the laboratory by air.\n\nEmployees and contractors working for Campbell at core logging facilities located at the Detour Lake site conducted sampling between 1979 and 1983. Sampling was conducted on new core from both surface and underground drilling completed by Campbell, as well as on selected intervals of older core from Amoco drilling. The procedures used were defined by Campbell, and Kallio (2006a, 2006b), who observed that they were similar for both underground and surface drill core. Most sampling of core from new drilling was conducted from the top to the bottom of the drill hole on standard 5 ft intervals, but with some occasional sampling on narrower intervals. Samples were split, extracting $1 / 2$ core with a mechanical splitter, but with some local whole core sampling. No information was available to explain where the different methods were used. Sampling of older core from Amoco drill programs was intermittently conducted. Results of the re-sampling indicate that program was focused on filling in gaps in sampling from previous work. The procedure for this resampling is unknown. Samples were shipped to the laboratory by road or air.\n\nSampling between 1987 and 1999 was conducted by employees and contractors working for the Detour Lake Mine geology department or Placer's exploration department, depending on which group was co-ordinating the work. Most sampling by the Detour Lake Mine geology department was carried out from top to bottom of the hole based on 1 m sample intervals, and whole core methods, with the exception of selected intervals of BQ or BQTK-size core, which were sometimes sawed in half to preserve a portion for future reference. Extra waste samples of 0.5 m in length were collected on either side of potentially gold-bearing structures to allow calculation of grade over a minimum 3 m width. The sampling by Placer's exploration department was targeted towards selected intervals of a drill hole that were considered to have the best potential for hosting significant mineralization. Sample widths varied from $0.3-1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$ in length and were delimited by geological boundaries. Collection of the samples was accomplished by sawing the corewith a core saw and extracting $1 / 2$ of the core. Observation of the cross piled core remaining from these holes indicates that the sawing was done along a consistent centerline and resulted in two equal core halves.\n\nEmployees working for Pelangio or High River Gold at a core logging facility located at the Detour Lake Mine site completed the 2004-2005 sampling. Most routine sampling was on 1 m widths, but narrowed locally to accommodate geological and mineralized zone boundaries. The minimum width for most intervals sampled was 0.50 m . Collection of the samples was conducted by a technician by extracting $1 / 2$ of the core in the boxes as marked by a geologist. Most samples in 2004 were collected by splitting with a hydraulic splitter, and most from samples in 2005, and specifically those drilled west of the open pit, were cut with a core saw.\n\nSampling during the 2006 Pelangio drill program was completed by employees and contractors working for Pelangio at a core logging facility located at the Detour Lake Mine site. Routine sampling was conducted at 1 m widths, but narrowed locally to as low as 0.50 m to accommodate geological and mineralized zone boundaries. Samples were collected by a technician by sawing of the NQ sized core into two equal halves and placing one half of the core into a plastic sample bag.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.1.2 Trade Winds\n\nTrade Winds sampled continuously within the mineralized zones at approximately 1 m intervals. All core collected from Trade Winds' drilling program was sampled on site under the supervision of a Trade Winds QP geologist. The core was split using a conventional splitter or cut using a diamond saw, placed into plastic sample bags with the tag, and placed in plastic containers for shipping in batches of 20 direct to ALS Chemex Laboratories (ALS Chemex) in Val-d'Or, Québec. All samples were stored in Trade Winds' core shed until they were shipped and half the core was left in the core boxes as a permanent record and stored on site at the core farm located in the airstrip stage-in area.\n\nFollowing the 2010 drill program, Trade Winds completed four acid \"near-total\" digestion standard multi-element ICP package (ME-ICP61) assays on select core intervals. A total of 53,664 samples were first analysed using a Pearson correlation table with the intent of screening elements that required in-depth studies. Results showed a moderate correlation with silver and bismuth and to a lesser degree with sulphur and cadmium. Gold assays $>10$ $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ showed a stronger bismuth and cadmium correlation.\n\nThe elements of interest, namely bismuth, chromium, magnesium, manganese, iron, zinc, and silver, were examined spatially in 3D to assess their usability for assisting the geological interpretation. Individually, the single elements did not indicate that they would help the model much.\n\nA weak to moderate correlation with gold and the degree of potassic alteration was observed for the Detour West area.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.1.3 Detour Gold\n\nDetour Gold personnel sampled on nominal 1 m sample intervals. Where gold was visible in the drill core, the sample was broken down into 0.5 m samples for gravimetric or screen metallic analyses. Samples were marked both on core and corresponding sample tags and bags. In each drill campaign, a single side of the core was consistently sampled. The portion to be saved was fitted back into the core box and kept as a permanent record. Samples were bagged and numbered by a technician and double-checked for accuracy.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.1.4 Kirkland Lake Gold\n\nKirkland Lake Gold personnel sampled exploration core continuously from top to bottom of every hole. Samples were selected according to lithology and vein structure. Samples were primarily between $0.5-1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$ with perceived non-auriferous core sampled up to 1.5 m . Sampling followed a cutline marked on the core by the logging geologist. A small percentage of the core was not sawn and was shipped as whole core samples.\nAll core was systematically sampled using the following procedures.\nCore was fitted together in the box with a cutting line delineated at the bottom of the core. In each campaign, a single side of the core was consistently sampled. The portion to be saved was fitted back into the core box to be kept as a permanent record.\n\nSamples were bagged immediately after cutting and a printed sample tag was attached to the sample bag as it was stapled shut.\n\nEach rig was assigned a specific zip tie color for any samples associated with it. The senior core technician ensured that these color assignments were in a location in the core cutting facility that is easily accessible by the core technicians.\n\nRice bag tags (stating dispatch name and samples within rice bag) and zip ties are prepped in advanced and the information double checked by the core technician assigned to the drill hole, and a due diligence check was performed at random by the senior core technician.\n\nOnce all samples were cut and bagged, the geologist assigned to the drill prepared the sample dispatch.\n\nGeotechnicians used sample reports generated by the database to verify correct standards and sequencing in samples; and samples were re-checked prior to shipping for accuracy before being released.\n\nIn general, for NQ core, five samples were placed in rice bags before being placed in sample bins or on shrink-wrapped pallets.\n\nThe senior core technician completed a visual inspection of the sample batches to be submitted. They signed off on the dispatch form to indicate that the submission was checked.Samples were shipped to assay laboratories using either shrink-wrapped pallets or large secure bins. Shipments were moved to an accessible location for transport on designated shipment days at the exploration camp site.\n\nThe samples were shipped directly from site by courier to certified off-site analytical laboratories for preparation and assaying. All sample shipments leaving site were tracked by the Kirkland Lake Gold-Detour Lake site warehouse. Analytical laboratories sent sample receipt confirmation to company representatives and verified that all samples were received for the appropriate dispatch.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.1.5 Agnico Eagle\n\nAgnico Eagle continued to use the same policies and procedures with respect to sampling and sample shipments that were used by Kirkland Lake Gold.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.1.6 Grade Control\n\nGrade control practices are reflective of the current open pit mining activities. Samples of $4-6 \\mathrm{~kg}$ are taken at 1 m intervals using a rotary cone splitter. Field duplicate samples are taken at a rate of one per drill hole for a 28 m hole and two per hole for 42 m holes. Commercial standards and blanks are included in the sample shipments.\n\nWhere placement of the RC drill is not possible, or on occasions where sampling for waste characterization only is required, blast holes are sampled at a spacing of $12 \\times 14 \\mathrm{~m}$ (every second section).\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.2 Underground Sampling Methods\n\nInformation on the underground sampling is abstracted from Kallio (2006).\nChip and muck sampling in most areas was conducted using standard procedures established by the Detour Lake Mine geology department.\n\nRoutine chip sampling was conducted by subdividing the face into a continuous series of 1 m wide panels, with only minor variations in width for changes to rock type and economic indicators. The number of samples per face ranged from 3-6. Samples were collected by hammering off chips of rock from within each of the panels. The average sample size was usually about one kilogram, but could vary from $0.5-2 \\mathrm{~kg}$. After 1996, the procedure was changed slightly so that the width of panels were set with boundaries defined by major changes in rock type and economic indicators such as quartz, pyrite, chalcopyrite, sulphide breccia veins and potassic alteration. The typical sample size was $1.5-2 \\mathrm{~kg}$.\n\nA modified chip sampling procedure was used by Placer Dome in the QK Zone. The width of the panels was governed by major changes in rock type and economic indicators, ranging from $0.30-1.0 \\mathrm{~m}$. Five samples were typically taken per face, typically $2-4 \\mathrm{~kg}$ in weight.\n\nRoutine muck sampling was conducted in most new development and in active stopes of the Detour Lake Mine. The procedure for taking the samples up to at least the end of 1990 consisted of grabbing approximately 1.5 kg of broken rock material from scoop bucketsand/or broken muck piles which was mainly -2 inch ( -51 mm ) in diameter. This procedure may have been modified after 1990 to include larger and more frequent sampling, but there is no firm documentation to support if or to indicate when this might have occurred. After 1996, samples were collected from scoop buckets, with the number collected being based on the mining method being used. For development headings and mechanized cut and fill stopes, a minimum of four samples per blast were taken with each sample consisting of approximately 5 kg of mixed fines and -3 inch ( -76 mm ) material. Under routine conditions, development headings had one sample collected for every five buckets, and longhole stopes had one sample taken for every 10 buckets, but this could be increased in situations where the grade declined to below the cut-off grade.\n\nCollection of muck samples in the QK zone area was conducted by the scoop operators. The basic procedure in all headings involved taking one sample for every five buckets with a minimum of five samples in total from each heading regardless of blast size. Each sample was approximately 5 kg in size and consisted of material between $1 / 2-3$ inches (13-76 mm) in size.\n\nSample chips and muck samples were not used in Mineral Resource estimation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.3 Bulk Sampling Methods\n\nInformation on the bulk sampling is abstracted from Kallio (2006).\nBulk sampling was conducted by Amoco in the late 1970s during the early project evaluation stages. These data are no longer available.\n\nPlacer Dome conducted bulk sampling in 1997 as part of the QK project. In total, 39 drift rounds comprising $6,718 \\mathrm{t}$ was extracted and transported to surface, where it was crushed and processed through a sampling tower. All of the drift rounds in the sample were mapped, channel sampled and muck sampled in detail during the extraction. Samples from the tower were then sent to Placer Dome's research laboratory in Vancouver for gravity concentratecyanide leach analysis.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.4 Density Determinations\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.4.1 Detour Lake\n\nPrior to late 2009, no systematic specific gravity measurements were taken during the Detour Gold drilling programs. The values used for the tonnage calculation relied mainly on historical data derived from prior production. During the life of the former Detour Lake Mine, the operator used a density of $2.9 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$. This number was used by Detour Gold as the average specific gravity for all rock types.\n\nFrom October 2009 to November 2010, Detour Gold staff completed specific gravity measurements on 4,603 samples using an inert gas pycnometer. The measurement wasconducted on the pulp fraction of every $40^{\\text {th }}$ sample. The average specific gravity value obtained from this program was $2.98 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nIn 2009, SGS Geostat conducted independent specific gravity measurements on 211 samples from twin drilled hole DG-09-806 and on 312 samples from compositing 24 drill holes (total leaching test), all located within the eastern part of the Detour Lake deposit. Results from the total leaching test and twin drill hole samples gave an average specific gravity of $2.9 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, SGS Geostat conducted additional specific gravity measurements on 120 duplicate half-core samples using the water displacement methodology (weight in air divided by the volume displaced by the core sample in a graduated cylinder). The independent verification of the specific gravity returned similar observations as the 2009 data verification program.\n\nThe massive, weakly-altered mafic volcanic units generally show higher specific gravity values $\\left(2.9-3.0 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\right)$ than the more altered pillowed mafic volcanic units $\\left(2.8-2.9 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\right)$. The more felsic lithologies observed in the eastern area of the deposit, typically as intermediate intrusive units, returned specific gravity values in the $2.7-2.8 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ range. The range of specific gravity values observed for the different lithologies generally reflects the variation in geochemical composition (including the intensity of alteration) and the natural porosity of the rock units. The average specific gravity value calculated from both data set supported the assumed historical specific gravity value of $2.9 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, was used in all studies by Detour Gold.\n\nIn 2020 Kirkland Lake Gold reviewed available bulk density values. Detour Gold samples, when combined with those of former operator Pelangio, represent a total of 7,045 samples that were collected for density from recently-drilled boreholes for various lithologies. Most of these samples were 1 m in length. A density value was determined for each assigned lithology code by constructing histograms and removing outliers and determining the average for each lithology. Lithologies without a bulk density were assigned an average density of $2.99 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nNo additional independent review of the specific gravity was done on the Detour deposit by SGS Geostat. WGM (2011) mentioned three composite measurements varying from 2.95$3.02 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, and a more exhaustive set of 632 data points ranging from $2.52-3.55 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ with an average of $2.91 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nStarting in 2020 through to 16 October, 2023 for the Detour exploration program, core was measured for specific gravity by Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle personnel using a Cruiser check weighing specific gravity station (CKT-8H) which uses a full core water immersion technique.\n\nIn total, 34,451 measurements were taken across the Detour deposit, with 291 measurements removed. A total of 34,160 were used with values ranging from 2.003$4.44 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, averaging $2.95 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ (Table 11-1). Note that a value of $2.95 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ was used for estimation purposes in Section 14.AGNICO EAGLE\n\nTable 11-1: 2020-2023 Core Specific Gravity\n\n| Lithology | Number of <br> Measurements | Specific <br> Gravity |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Mafic flow | 6,719 | 2.93 |\n| Volcanic pillow flows | 21,690 | 2.97 |\n| Chloritic greenstone | 698 | 2.93 |\n| Gabbro | 664 | 2.99 |\n| Diorite | 137 | 2.90 |\n| Ultramafic intrusive | 314 | 3.00 |\n| Mafic intrusive | 656 | 2.94 |\n| Intermediate intrusive | 1,871 | 2.79 |\n| Felsic intrusive | 648 | 2.71 |\n| Chert equivalent | 56 | 2.68 |\n| Talc-chlorite | 17 | 2.94 |\n| Metasediments | 347 | 2.83 |\n| FW mafic volcanics | 276 | 2.98 |\n| Fault zone | 59 | 2.85 |\n| Quartz vein | 8 | 2.69 |\n|  | Total 34,160 | Average 2.95 |\n\nThe exploration team selected core samples every 20 m starting at the top of the drill hole, selecting a 10 cm piece of core for measurement.

A total of 2,644 measurements were completed, and values ranged from 2.09$3.68 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, averaging $2.8 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.5 Analytical And Test Laboratories\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.5.1 Primary Laboratories\n\nWhere known, the laboratories used during the legacy programs included Assayers Limited, in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, (Assayers); the Dome Mine Laboratory in Timmins (Dome laboratory), Ontario; Swastika Laboratories Ltd, in Swastika, Ontario (Swastika); the Detour Lake Mine assay laboratory (Detour Lake laboratory); X-Ral Laboratories in RouynNoranda, Quebec (X-Ral); Bondar Clegg in Ottawa, Ontario (Bondar Clegg); Chemex Laboratories in Mississauga, Ontario (Chemex Mississauga); Chemex Laboratories inRouyn-Noranda, Quebec (Chemex Rouyn-Noranda); Accurassay Laboratories in Thunder Bay, Ontario (Accurassay Thunder Bay); and Activation Laboratories Ltd in Timmins, Ontario (Actlabs). Accreditations at the time the work was performed is not known. All laboratories other than the Dome laboratory and the Detour Lake laboratory were independent of the operators at the time. All laboratories were independent of Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\nDetour Gold used SGS Minerals in Garson, Ontario (SGS Garson) and Don Mills, Ontario (SGS Don Mills), Ontario for sample preparation and SGS Don Mills for analysis during the 2007-2012 Detour Lake and 2012 West Detour drill campaigns. At the time the laboratories held ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\nSamples from the 2008-2013 Detour Gold campaigns were sent to Accurassay in Timmins, Ontario (Accurassay Timmins) for sample preparation and to Accurassay Thunder Bay for analysis. The laboratories held ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\nFor the 2014-2015 regional exploration programs (including Zone 58N), Detour Gold sent all of its samples to ALS Minerals in Sudbury, Ontario (ALS Sudbury) for sample preparation. Analysis was completed by ALS Minerals in Vancouver, B.C. (ALS Vancouver). The laboratories held ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\nDuring the Detour Gold campaigns of 2016-2017, sample preparation was performed at ALS Sudbury, and analysis at a number of ALS Minerals laboratories globally, including Vancouver; Val-d'Or in Québec (ALS Val-d'Or); Reno in Nevada; and on rare occasions in Lima in Peru and Loughrea in Ireland. The laboratories held ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\nFor the 2018-2019 regional exploration campaigns, Detour Gold sent samples to ALS Timmins for sample preparation, with analysis completed at ALS Vancouver. The laboratories held ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\nFrom 2020-2023, Kirkland Lake Gold used ALS Minerals, with sample preparation completed at ALS Timmins and analysis at ALS Vancouver. Exploration samples were also submitted to Actlabs (Activation Laboratories, Timmins), AGAT Laboratories in Mississauga (AGAT) and up until April 2021, SGS Laboratories in Cochrane (SGS Cochrane). The laboratories were independent of Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.5.2 Secondary/Check Laboratories\n\nALS Vancouver was used as a secondary laboratory for the 2012 drill campaigns.The 2020-2023 check assay program executed by Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle consisted of re-analyzing approximately one out of every 15 samples sent with each dispatch. The laboratories used during the drill campaign were instructed to return 100 g splits of pulp material for every $15^{\\text {th }}$ sample sent. These pulps were then sorted by Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle geologists and resubmitted to one of two primary laboratories, ALS or Actlabs, ensuring that the original laboratory did not conduct the check assay. Check assays were completed mimicking the original sample analysis and QA/QC procedures.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.5.3 Grade Control\n\nGrade control samples are analysed at SGS Cochrane and Actlabs. The laboratories currently hold ISO17025 accreditation for selected analytical techniques. The laboratories were independent of Detour Gold and Kirkland Lake Gold and are independent of Agnico Eagle.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.6 Sample Preparation And Analysis\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.6.1 Legacy\n\nInformation on the legacy sample preparation and analysis is abstracted from Kallio (2006).\nThe 1974-1979 samples were prepared by grinding split core to $1 / 4$ inch, selecting a half-assay-ton sub sample and fire assaying. Samples from later drill holes were prepared with a mixture of whole core and split core sampling methods whereby the core was ground to 100 mesh, split to one-assay-ton and fire assayed.\n\nAlthough no records are available at the Dome laboratory, crushing and grinding of samples in the period 1979-1987 used a cone crusher and manual pulverizer and all analysis was completed using fire assay of a one-assay-ton sub-sample. The procedures used at Swastika in the same time frame are unknown.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1991, procedures were the same for all core sizes and consisted of crushing to $-1 / 2$ inch using a Rhino crusher, followed by splitting of 150 g and pulverization to -150 mesh. Samples were weighed at 10 g and analyzed using an aqua regia digestion and ketone extraction method. Most of the intervals were only assayed once, but some containing higher-grade and visible gold were checked with a second assay of the pulp.\n\nFrom 1995-1999, the same procedure was used for all core sizes and consisted of crushing to -10 mesh, followed by splitting of 300 g and pulverization to -200 mesh. Samples were weighed, and fused, followed by cupellation. Samples were digested in nitric acid and hydrochloric acid and analyzed using atomic absorption (AA) fitted with an autosampler. Most of intervals were assayed only once, with some intervals containing higher grades and visible gold being assayed twice.\n\nThe chip and muck samples collected from 1987-1999 underwent the same initial steps as for drill core samples, followed by weighing, digestion in 30 ml of aqua regia and filtration. This was followed by addition of 10 ml of ketone and analysis using AA.The routine procedure for most core samples to the end of 1993, involved the crushing of samples weighing between $1-2 \\mathrm{~kg}$ to approximately -10 mesh, followed by splitting out and pulverizing to -150 mesh a subsample weighing approximately $250-300 \\mathrm{~g}$, splitting and analysis of a 1 assay tonne subsample using fire assay and AA finish. This procedure seems to have been slightly modified in 1993 to include re-assaying of certain higher-grade samples with either the same processes as the initial sample or with a pulp and metallic procedure. The detection limit for all gold assaying at Swastika was $0.001 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$, at Assayers was $0.05 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ and at X-Ral was $0.01 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\nThe procedure at Chemex from 1993 involved crushing of samples to -10 mesh, followed by splitting and pulverization of a 150 g sub-sample using a ring and puck pulverizer and splitting and analysis of a 30 gram subsample. Initial assaying of samples at Chemex was often conducted with fire assay and an AA finish that had an upper limit of $12 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$. Samples exceeding the upper limit were usually re-assayed using a fire assay and gravimetric finish. A large number of samples with visible gold and higher-grade values from the initial assaying were also usually re-analyzed with pulp and metallic methods. The detection limit for all assaying at Chemex was $0.03 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\nThe 2004-2005 protocols at ALS Mississauga included dry crushing of samples to $>70 \\%$ passing -10 mesh ( 2 mm screen), riffle splitting and pulverization of 250 g subsamples to $>85 \\%$ passing $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ screens and fire assaying of one-assay-ton subsamples. Samples with visible gold were analyzed with a pulp and metallics procedure.\nProtocols at Accurassay Thunder Bay included crushing to $90 \\%-10$ mesh and then splitting of a 30 g sub-sample and pulverizing to -150 mesh. Analysis was usually done with the fire assay technique except for intervals containing free gold or elevated values on the initial analysis, which were done using the pulp and metallics procedure. The pulp and metallics procedure in 2004 was based on a 1 kg split, but this was adjusted in 2005 to total pulverization.\nFor the 2006 program, samples were processed at Swastika using dry crushing to $>90 \\%$ passing -10 mesh, riffle splitting and pulverization of 350 g sub-samples. The analysis was conducted using fire assay of one-assay-ton sub-samples then using pulp and metallic screen procedures for samples with visible gold.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.6.2 Trade Winds/Detour Gold\n\nThe sample preparation used at SGS Don Mills and SGS Garson consisted of crushing to $90 \\%$ passing -10 mesh ( 2 mm ), riffle splitting to obtain a 500 g subsample, pulverizing to $90 \\%$ passing 200 mesh $(75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})$ and sub-sampling to obtain a 50 g pulp for assaying.\nFor Block A, samples by Trade Winds were sent to ALS Val-d'Or and ALS Vancouver from 2003-2010. Sample preparation consists of crushing to $70 \\%$ passing -10 mesh ( 2 mm ), riffle splitting to obtain a 1 kg subsample, pulverizing to $85 \\%$ passing 200 mesh $(75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})$ and sub-sampling to obtain a 50 g pulp (Au-AA24) for assaying. For 2011, Trade Winds sent their samples to Actlabs where the preparation procedure was very similar to the one used by the ALS laboratories.Starting in 2007, routine gold analysis for the Detour Lake deposit was done using fire assaying with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish (SGS Code FAA515) then later an inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) finish (SGS Code FAI505 and FAI525). Where the gold assays exceeded $10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$, the fire assay was repeated with a gravimetric finish (SGS Code FAG505). All samples with visible gold identified during the field logging procedure went directly to the metallic screen procedures (SGS Code FAS30K and FAS31K) using a nominal 500 g split of the original -10 mesh sample ( 2 mm ). All routine assayed samples (fire assay AAS or fire assay-gravimetric) returning values $\\geq 5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ on the first analysis were reanalyzed using the metallic screen procedure. For the metallic screen procedure, the sub-samples were screened at -150 mesh ( $106 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ ), and then both the coarse and fine fractions (duplicate and often triplicate assays on the fine fraction) were completed using fire assaying with an inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) finish. Selected samples were also analyzed for copper using sodium peroxide fusion and ICP-OES finish.\nThe sample preparation procedure at Accurassay Timmins, used from 2008-2013, consisted of crushing to $75 \\%$ passing -8 mesh, riffle splitting to obtain a 500 g subsample, pulverizing to $85 \\%$ passing 200 mesh, and sub-sampling to obtain a 50 g pulp.\nDuring the 2014-2017 drill campaigns, the routine sample preparation at ALS Sudbury included drying and crushing the full sample to $70 \\% 2 \\mathrm{~mm}$ or better, splitting to obtain a 1 kg sub-sample, pulverizing to $85 \\%$ passing $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, and sub-sampling again to obtain a 50 g .\nDifferent analytical protocols were used, depending on whether the assay sample was classified as deposit-related (Table 11-2) or exploration (Table 11-3).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.6.3 Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle\n\nIn 2020-2023, Kirkland Lake Gold and Agnico Eagle used ALS Minerals, Actlabs, AGAT, and SGS laboratories for analytical services. Sample preparation at each laboratory is similar, with samples being initially logged in the tracking system, weighed, dried, and finely crushed to better than $70 \\%$ passing a 2 mm (Tyler 9 mesh, US Std. No.10) screen. A split of up to 500 g is taken using a Boyd rotary splitter and pulverized to better than $85 \\%$ passing a $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ (Tyler 200 mesh, US Std. No. 200) screen.\nSample assaying was completed using fire assay techniques with samples $<10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ being analyzed using AAS and samples $>10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ analyzed with a gravimetric finish. Samples containing visible gold along with the sample immediately proceeding and immediately after the visible gold were analyzed using a screen metallics procedure (Table 11-4).\nAt SGS, a portion of the samples analyzed by fire assay were finished using ICP-OES on a 50.0 g sample and samples $>10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ analyzed with a gravimetric finish.Table 11-2: Detour Gold Analytical Methods, Deposits\n\n| January 2007 to <br> July 2007 |  | August 2007 to <br> June 2008 |  | July 2008 to <br> November 2012 |  | 2016 |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| SGS <br> Code | Description | SGS <br> Code | Description | SGS <br> Code | Description | ALS <br> Code | Description |\n| FAA515 | 50 g fire <br> assay with <br> AAS finish (5 <br> ppb to 10 <br> ppm) | FAI505 | 50 g fire assay <br> with ICP-AES <br> finish (1 to <br> $10,000 \\mathrm{ppb})$ | FAI525 | 50 g fire assay <br> with ICP-AES <br> finish (5 to <br> $10,000 \\mathrm{ppb})$ | Au-AA24 | 50 g fire <br> assay with <br> AAS finish <br> (2.5 to <br> $10,000 \\mathrm{ppb})$ |\n| FAG505 | 50 g fire <br> assay with <br> gravimetric <br> finish for Au <br> $>10 \\mathrm{ppm}$ | FAG505 | 50 g fire assay <br> with <br> gravimetric <br> finish (for Au <br> $>10 \\mathrm{ppm}$ ) | FAG505 | 50 g fire assay <br> with gravimetric <br> finish (for Au <br> $>10 \\mathrm{ppm}$ ) | Au- <br> GRA22 | 50 g fire <br> assay with <br> gravimetric <br> finish (for Au <br> $>10 \\mathrm{ppm}$ ) |\n| FAS30K | Gold by <br> screen <br> metallics: Fire <br> Assay on 500 <br> g screened at <br> $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ (for Au <br> $>5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ or <br> visible gold) - <br> on second <br> pulp from the <br> reject | FAS31K | Gold by <br> screen <br> metallics: Fire <br> assay on 500 <br> g screened at <br> $106 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ (for Au <br> $>5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ or <br> visible gold) - <br> on second <br> pulp from the <br> reject | FAS31K | Gold by screen <br> metallics: Fire <br> assay on 500 g <br> screened at 106 <br> $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ (for $\\mathrm{Au}>5$ <br> $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ ) - a second <br> pulp is prepared <br> from the reject | Au- <br> SCR24 | Screen <br> metallic on <br> selected <br> samples <br> following <br> gravimetric <br> analysis |\n\nTable 11-3: Detour Gold Analytical Methods, Exploration\n\n| 2008-2013 | 2014 | 2015-2017 |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Accurassay Timmins | ALS Vancouver | ALS Vancouver |\n| Fire assay with AAS finish on a <br> 50.2 g sample | Fire assay with AAS finish on a 50 <br> g sample | Fire assay with AAS finish on a 50 <br> sample |\n| Fire assay repeated with a <br> gravimetric finish when assays <br> $>3 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ | Samples with visible gold or $>3 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ <br> Au follow screen metallic analysis. <br> Fire assay with gravimetric finish on <br> $1,000 \\mathrm{~g}$ split screened at $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ | Fire assay repeated with a gravimetric <br> finish when assays $>3 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ or with <br> visible gold.

A 500 g split is then pulverized to $85 \\%$ passing 200 mesh $(75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})$, then sub-sampled again to obtain a 50 g pulp for assaying.\n\nSamples are assayed using assay with an ICP-OES finish. Sulphur and carbon analysis are done on 14 m composites (equivalent to one bench) using LECO.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.7 Quality Assurance And Quality Control\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.7.1 Legacy\n\nInformation on the QA/QC programs is abstracted from Kallio (2006).\nQC for the 1974-1983 period was from the laboratories involved, and is predominantly no longer available.\n\nCheck sampling conducted by Amoco in 1976 included a comparison of assays from duplicate core halves, pulps and rejects which were initially assayed at Assayers and reassayed at Swastika, and indicates a reasonably good correspondence between the two data sets.\n\nA comparison of fire assays with complete leaching was conducted in 1978 by IREM-MERI using 245 duplicate halves of NQ core collected by Amoco. This program had one side ofthe drill core assayed using fire assay, and the second half assayed using complete leaching. The results of the comparisons indicated no overall bias, but a tendency for the original low-grade samples to be slightly underestimated and original high-grade samples to be slightly overestimated, with the point of reversal being at approximately 0.30 oz/ton.\n\nDuring 1991-1992, Swastika re-assayed one pulp for approximately every 20 samples processed as well as most original assays when the gold value was $>1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$. Placer's exploration department undertook a blind re-assay program by having Chemex re-assay 250 Swastika rejects. During 1992, Assayers re-analyzed one pulp for every 20 samples processed, one reject for every 25 samples, and most original assays when the gold value was $>1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\nThe 1993 program comprised routine checking of pulps by X-Ral, consisting of reanalyzing one pulp for approximately every 25 samples processed. Placer's exploration department had samples grading greater than 500 ppb Au re-assayed, required reanalysis of samples grading $>5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ or with visible gold at a second laboratory using pulp and metallics, and requested Chemex re-assay selected samples.\n\nQuality control procedures after 1993 included routine insertion of quality control standards, blanks, and duplicates by Chemex laboratories as well as re-assaying of selected samples with visible gold and/or unusually high initial results with pulp and metallics. Kallio (2006) noted that one 'in-house' or Canmet standard plus a blank and a duplicate were inserted into the sample stream for every batch of 20 samples.\n\nProcedures for 2005 included duplicates, blank core samples and standards inserted at the approximate rate of one in 20 samples processed at the site as well as routine quality control by ALS Chemex and Accurassay. All samples with visible gold or returning initial results $>10 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ were re-analyzed with pulp and metallics. Review of the blank and standard results indicated that most were within a reasonable tolerance of the original value. Many of the duplicate data had a wide spread, which resulted in the duplicates being reassayed using pulp and metallics.\n\nPelangio conducted a verification program on selected samples from 1982-1995 through re-assaying of original and new pulps. The reviews supported the earlier observation of a wide spread in assay results from duplicate data.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.7.2 Detour Gold\n\nDuring the period 2007-2011, Detour Gold had the following QA/QC sample insertion rates for the Detour Lake drill programs: coarse blanks, 1:40; standard reference material s(standards), 1:40; drill core duplicates, 1:40; and preparation duplicates, 1:30. Certified reference materials used during this timeframe consisted of nine different standards purchased from OREAS (Australia) (OREAS).\n\nThere was no evidence of systematic gold contamination based on the blanks that were inserted with the sample stream. In addition, there was no bias evident between original and duplicate halves of the drill core that could indicate that technicians were preferentially submitting the more mineralized half of the core for assay. Differences between coreduplicate assays were expected based on the review of reproducibility for preparation duplicates.\n\nQA/QC for the Block A area prior to 2012 included insertion of standards, blanks, and duplicates. Insertion rates are not known. Blanks were barren granite material, and standards were sourced from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. and Rocklabs Ltd., independent suppliers of standards to the mining industry. Review of the QA/QC program indicated no significant instances of bias or contamination.\n\nDetour Gold followed the same QA/QC procedures in 2012 for the Block A area as for Detour Lake. QA/QC samples included blanks, standards, and duplicates. There was no evidence of systematic gold contamination based on the blanks that were inserted with samples. The standard data indicated a change in the performance of SGS Don Mills during the year. All of the low-grade standards ( $0.3-1.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ) showed a low bias in the order of $-5 \\%$ and very high failures rates; whereas the high-grade standard performed well. It was concluded that SGS Don Mills made changes to its fire assay procedures that resulted in a low bias post-May 2012 for gold concentrations $<1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. In general, the reproducibility for preparation duplicates was similar to previous periods and within expected ranges. Results for pulp duplicates were very similar to data for preparation duplicates; reproducibility issues were noted in the finer-ground materials. The reproducibility was similar to the results for preparation duplicates for the Detour Lake deposit and within expected ranges. There was no bias evident between original and duplicate halves of the drill core.\n\nA metallics versus fire assay comparison was performed on the 2012 Block A data. The subset of samples selected on the basis of original 50 g fire assay determinations agreed reasonably well with the FA-MET re-analyses. Selected sample pulps and core samples originally assayed by SGS Don Mills were re-assayed at SGS Cochrane. SGS Don Mills assays were biased high by $4.84 \\%$ when compared to the SGS Cochrane assays on the suite of samples selected for check assays. SGS Cochrane reported on average 5\\% low on the standards included with samples, suggesting that the two sets of assays were comparable.\n\nThe QA/QC samples included in the 2016 West Detour drilling had the following insertion rates: coarse blank, 1:20; and standard, 1:20. Standards used were from Oreas. The blank material was crushed limestone. Core duplicates were omitted from this drilling program following a review of historical duplicate data. There was no evidence of systematic gold contamination based on the blanks that were inserted with the samples. The standard data results were in an acceptable range.\n\nThe Zone 58N drilling programs from 2014-2017 had coarse blanks and standards inserted at a 1:20 rate. Standards were sourced from OREAS. No duplicates were used. The blank material was a crushed limestone. There was no evidence of systematic gold contamination based on the blanks that were inserted with the samples.\n\nStandard re-assays were not requested if the results were within $\\pm 10-15 \\%$ or within waste rock. Plotting of the standard results for 2014-2015 showed a low bias for samples processed prior to August 2014; however, most were within the -15\\% range. Review of the2016 standard results indicated an issue with the gravimetric fire assay method. Investigation showed that the Au-GRAV assay was being done on a 10 g sample instead of the 50 g and this smaller sample caused problems when trying to remove the silver from the doré bead. Detour Gold instructed ALS Vancouver to discontinue assaying using FAGRAV on $<20 \\mathrm{~g}$ of material, and discontinue FA-GRAV if the original sample assayed $<5.0$ $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. In 2017, the blank material was changed to a silica sand. The 2017 standard results were considered to be acceptable.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.7.3 Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle\n\nKirkland Lake Gold implemented a systematic QA/QC program for exploration drilling in 2020 that included the insertion of one standard and one coarse blank material every 20 samples dispatched. One coarse blank or a standard was inserted within every 10 samples. The standard was generally inserted close to samples that are anticipated to be auriferous. Where visible gold was observed a high-grade standard was placed prior to the sample and a coarse blank was placed after the sample along with a wash code designation communicated to the analytical laboratory to ensure a silica wash was completed immediately after the sample containing visible gold was crushed.\nKirkland Lake Gold used six OREAS gold standards, specifically OREAS209 (1.58 g/t Au), OREAS216b ( $6.66 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ), OREAS217 ( $0.338 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ), OREAS219 ( $0.76 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ), OREAS223 ( $1.78 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ), and OREAS231 ( $0.542 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ).\nAt ALS Vancouver, internal laboratory checks included the insertion of one blank, two standards, and three duplicates for every 78 samples (per fusion furnace).\nQA/QC conducted by Actlabs consisted of the insertion of two blanks every 24 samples, one preparation duplicate every 50 samples, one laboratory duplicate every 10 samples, and multiple standards for every 24 samples.\nSGS Laboratories' QC materials included method blanks, replicates and reference materials and are randomly inserted with the frequency set according to method protocols at $\\sim 12 \\%$. QC materials could also include barren reference materials, or preparation blanks and preparation duplicates if samples had been taken through the sample reduction process. Verification of balance calibration was performed daily.\nAGAT Laboratories ensured certified reference materials were weighed and processed at least every 20 samples or once per fusion set if the set was $<20$ samples. Replicates and duplicates were chosen at random and processed every 20 samples or once per fusion set if the set was $<20$ samples.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.7.4 Grade Control\n\nQA/QC of all RC and blast holes is monitored on a daily basis using an acQuire database system. All assays that pass QA/QC are accepted into the database, while assays that fail the QA/QC are reanalyzed by SGS Cochrane as per the mine's QA/QC procedure.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.8 Databases\n\nThe original Detour Gold database consisted of three Access databases covering three different projects Detour (Main Mine), Regional, and West. Agnico Eagle merged the three databases into one Fusion database with each drill hole being applied a \"Project Number\" that reflects the Access database they originated from. Two business units were created in the Fusion database to retain the old data while allowing for new rules to be applied for future logging (limits for sample lengths, overlaps in data, etc.). The \"HISTORIC\" business unit contains all the data from the Access databases and the DETOUR business unit will be used for future logging. Any discrepancies or questions were directed to the database manager who created the Access databases.\n\nThe Fusion tables were set up with fields to effectively enter new data while retaining the original data from the Access database. Fields containing original data that were altered during migration are not available to the loggers for future reference but can be accessed by querying the database. Reference tables were created for drop-down pick lists that consist of a comprehensive compilation of the data in the Access databases.\n\nKirkland Lake Gold performed a major data verification exercise during the data migration to Fusion. Verification procedures included the review and modifications of coordinates, surveys, samples, lithologies, alteration, mineralization, deformation, structure, veining, and RQD data.\n\nCurrently, logging, and geotechnical data are directly uploaded from the logging software directly into the Fusion database. Collar survey data are uploaded from a differential global positioning system (DGPS) Topcon GR3 instrument with a Nikon total station instrument to the fusion database in UTM coordinates. The down-hole survey data source from the Reflex Gyro Sprint-IQ and Reflex EZ Trac instrument are uploaded using a computerized hub. The specific gravity measurements are hand-entered into the database.\n\nAll data are checked using inbuilt software checking routines.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.9 Sample Security\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.9.1 Legacy\n\nThe information on compilation of the legacy data into a database is abstracted from Kallio (2006).\n\nThe vast majority of samples appear to have been collected by experienced and knowledgeable personnel working for Placer, Campbell, Amoco and Pelangio at core facilities located at or quite near to the site of drilling. The facilities used by Amoco and Campbell would have been located at an exploration site with relatively restricted access, and those by Placer Dome were at an operating minesite which would have been monitored closely by personnel from both the Security and Geology departments, with relatively limited access to others. The facilities used by Pelangio were located close to the original mine buildings.Procedures for sampling, handling, shipping, and analyzing the samples were defined by personnel from each company who were considered to be competent and knowledgeable in their respective fields of work. Sample tagging by Placer, for at least the later parts of the mine life, was done using a bar code system, which should have resulted in less possibility for analytical errors. Transportation of samples to the assay laboratory from early programs was by air and/or ground transport with minimal ability for tampering by outside personnel. Transportation of most of the later samples collected by Detour Gold, which were being processed at an onsite laboratory, was by a truck driven by workers at the site. Transportation of samples collected by Placer Dome and Pelangio, which were being processed at off site laboratories would have been by a truck driven by employees working on the drill programs or bonded carrier.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.9.2 Detour Gold\n\nSample security was monitored by Detour Gold security and exploration staff. Samples were placed individually in plastic bags and transported within marked and sealed rice bags by courier directly to analytical laboratories. Sample collection from drill point to laboratory relies upon the fact that samples are either always attended to, or stored in the locked onsite preparation facility, or stored in a secure area prior to laboratory shipment.\nChain-of-custody procedures consist of sample submittal forms to be sent to the laboratory with sample shipments to ensure that all samples are received by the laboratory.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 11.9.3 Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle\n\nSamples were directly shipped from site, using Gold Heart Courier to certified off-site analytical laboratories for preparation and assaying. All sample shipments leaving site were tracked by the Kirkland Lake Gold-Detour Lake site warehouse. Analytical laboratories send sample receipt confirmation to Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle representatives and verify all samples are received for the appropriate dispatch.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.10 Sample Storage\n\nDetour Gold compiled a complete inventory of the historical core on site. Much of the early historical drill core is in deteriorating condition due to decay of the core trays.\n\nMany of the older pulps and rejects from both Detour Lake and West Detour were stored in a dome (Weatherhaven tent) in Cochrane. During a severe snowstorm in the winter of 2016, the dome collapsed and the subsequent winter snow and spring rain damaged the cardboard boxes (shrink-wrapped with plastic on wooden pellets). Following the removal of the collapsed structure, many of the boxes were damaged and not recoverable. The pressure of two layers of pellets crushed the cardboard boxes with water penetrating bags or erasing markings on boxes and on pulp envelopes. The recoverable portion was moved to permanent storage facilities at site.\n\nAll pulps since 2014, and most of the rejects, are stored at Agnico Eagle's Cochrane facility.All core boxes in which samples were collected during the Detour Gold and Agnico Eagle programs were placed in steel core racks or on pallets at the Agnico Eagle core storage facility, which is not individually guarded but is located within the mine site controlled area.\nAll core boxes in which samples were collected during the 2020-2021 exploration programs were placed in steel core racks at the onsite exploration facility, or on pallets and stored in designated core storage areas, which are not individually guarded but reside within the mine site controlled area.\n\nAll 2020-2024 pulps, and most of the rejects, are either stored onsite or remain in storage at the Actlabs, SGS Cochrane, AGAT and ALS Vancouver facilities.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 11.11 Comments On Sample Preparation, Analyses And Security\n\nIn the opinion of the QP:\n\n- Sample collection, preparation, analysis, and security for core drill programs are in line with industry-standard methods for gold deposits at the time the samples were collected;\n- Drill programs included insertion of blank, duplicate, and standard reference material samples;\n- QA/QC methods are practiced during density measurement programs, which are industry leading practices;\n- QA/QC program results do not indicate any problems with the analytical programs (refer to discussion in Section 12);\n- Data are subject to validation, which includes checks on surveys, collar co-ordinates, and assay data. The checks are appropriate, and consistent with industry standards (refer to discussion in Section 12);\n- Retained core has been catalogued and is stored in designated core storage facilities.\n\nThe QP is of the opinion that the quality of the gold analytical data is sufficiently reliable to support Mineral Resource estimation without limitations on Mineral Resource confidence categories."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 12.1 Historical Verification Programs\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.1 2005-2006\n\nVery little data verification work was documented prior to 2005. Kallio $(2005,2006)$ completed an initial verification program of the historical drill hole database and conducted some independent check sampling of the pre-2004 and Pelangio assay data (Kallio, 2006). The validation of the database information versus the historical records did not return any significant errors. Only minor discrepancies related to data entry errors, inconsistent coding, rounding errors or missing data were identified. Independent check sampling of 96 historical drill core intervals indicated poor correspondence of grades between historic and new assays, high variability between duplicates and tendencies for most new assays to be lower than the original. Additional data verification on the Pelangio drilling indicated minor errors in the database. Check assays of core, pulps and rejects were also conducted. Results from the check assays showed a significant variability between comparative assays with higher values returned from the check assays.\n\nKallio (2006) also conducted some comparison of assay results from different drill programs located within a test block of the Detour Lake deposit and undertook comparisons of paired Pelangio and historical drill holes in close proximity to each other. Results indicated significant variation in average grades between each drill program at different cut-off grades, with Pelangio drill holes having the highest average grade. Reasons for these differences were not identified, and it was suggested that the unknown quality of historical assay procedures, inconsistent determination of historic capping levels, small core sizes, and the historical practice of assay averaging may have contributed to the discrepancies. Kallio (2006) recommended additional verification of the historical assay data.\nIn 2008, WGM conducted some independent check sampling of the Detour Gold assay data with no significant database verification.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.2 2009\n\nAs part of the pre-feasibility study (Met-Chem, 2009), further database verification work was carried out in early 2009 by Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA). The database verification program consisted of a review of the digital database against all available data including original logs, survey documents, assay certificates, underground void wireframes, topography, and plotted maps. Collar coordinates, downhole surveys, geology, and assays were checked from a random selection of drill holes from each historic drilling campaign. Additional checks were completed on specific holes that could have a significant effect on local high-grade block estimates and holes that were questionable due to location or inconsistent data.\n\nAs Detour Gold drill hole data and underground voids were captured independently of each other, an additional validation comparing their relative locations was conducted. Althoughthe distances between drill hole breakthroughs and voids vary, most breakthroughs could be explained by the presence of a modeled void in the vicinity.\n\nChecks on duplicate pulps, preparation samples and core samples were carried out on the Detour Gold drill hole data. Results indicated that precision of all samples, including pulp duplicates, was extremely variable even at low grades. Assay precision will influence the selection of appropriate grade interpolation parameters and method for resource estimation.\n\nScott Wilson RPA concluded that the drilling, data collection and QA/QC procedures undertaken by Detour Gold corresponded to industry standard practices and were considered to be acceptable.\n\nScott Wilson RPA conducted studies to assess drill hole data reliability for use in resource estimation. Comparisons were run between Detour Gold holes and all other previously drilled holes within separate domains and test blocks for Detour Lake.\n\nResults indicated that over large domains, average grades showed reasonable to poor correlation; however, similar distinct trends existed locally between the datasets. Historic holes generally contained local higher average gold grades compared to Detour Gold holes and reflected local trends dependent on hole locations. Detour Gold assays were distributed at relatively equal spacing throughout the domains and may be more representative of the overall gold grades.\n\nScott Wilson RPA recommended additional studies to assess the validity of historic underground holes especially in the area below the current influence of Detour Gold surface holes ( 5,900 metres elevation) involving reconciliation of historic assays with underground production (after final stope models have been generated) and additional data collection at depth.\n\nScott Wilson RPA was of the opinion that the database finalized in June 2009 was valid and acceptable for use in Mineral Resource estimation work.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.3 2009-2010\n\nAs part of the Detour Lake feasibility study, SGS Geostat conducted an extensive statistical review and data verification program in late 2009 (BBA, 2010). The data verification program included:\n\n- Verification of the drill hole database versus historical records;\n- Independent check sampling of some historical assay data;\n- Drilling of five independent holes designed to twin recent Detour Gold holes and historical holes;\n- Total gold analysis of 24 composites located with a test block using gravity concentration and cyanide leaching.\n\nThe SGS Geostat data verification program led to the following conclusions.Comparison of the mean gold grade in the same block between the Detour Gold analytical data and the historical data showed a mean grade systematically higher for the historical data. In order to diminish this discrepancy, the missing assay values from the historical drill holes were replaced with $0.01 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\nCheck sampling had identified a potential positive bias for the historical assays from hole CRL-039. In order to quantify the effect of a potential analytical bias toward some of the historical drill assays, SGS Geostat conducted a resource estimation exercise on the mineralized Domain 2 with the objective of quantifying the effect of the CRL series assays on the overall gold content of the mineralized domain. Based on these results, SGS Geostat considered the effect of removing the historical CRL series drill holes to be insignificant compared to overall gold content in the Detour Lake deposit.\n\nThe twin drilling campaign conducted as part of the independent verification program showed a fair to good correlation between the historical and Detour Gold assay data collected from the twin drill holes. From the total of five holes completed for this test, hole CRL-030 was the only hole showing poor correlation with the original data.\n\nTotal gold analysis (using gravity concentration coupled with bulk cyanidation) was conducted over 24 recent drill sections contained within a test block located just west of the former Campbell pit to characterize the nugget effect for a localized area of the Detour Lake deposit. Results showed a good relationship between the calculated head grade from the total gold analysis data and the fire assay data used by Detour Gold. Overall, the program demonstrated that the original fire assays used by Detour Gold in the test block area was a good approximation of the total gold content estimated from the gravity and cyanidation test work.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.4 2010-2011\n\nAs part of the 2010 and 2011 year-end Mineral Resource estimation updates, SGS Geostat conducted independent check sampling on selected 2010-2011 Detour Gold drill core and independent measurement of the specific gravity on the check core samples to validate the average specific gravity value of the Detour Lake deposit.\n\nIndependent check sampling was carried out on 60 samples selected from drill holes in 2010 and 57 samples selected from drill holes in 2011. Overall, the assay results of the duplicate samples showed a good correlation with the original assays except for the samples with high gold values. For 2010, all the samples with gold $>5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ returned gold values lower than the original samples. For 2011, eight samples were originally higher than $5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$, with four (or $50 \\%$ ) returning gold values greater than the original samples. Based on sorted average values, 13 samples for 2010 and 2011 were $>5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$, which was not enough to statistically define any analytical bias for these high values. However, the results showed significant variability of the high-grade samples due to the nugget effect and the importance in the application of a conservative capping of the assays used for the Mineral Resource estimation. A significant variability was observed between the original and duplicate results. The variability observed for the duplicate samples was in line with Detour Gold's QA/QC results for half core duplicates collected since 2007.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.5 2012-2013\n\nAs part of the 2012 and 2013 year-end Mineral Resource estimation update for West Detour, SGS Geostat conducted an independent analytical check program during 2012 and 2013 on selected Detour Gold drill core (from 2011 and 2012) in the western part of the Detour Lake deposit and eastern portion of the West Detour deposit, and on selected Trade Winds drill core in the western portion of the West Detour deposit. A total of 193 quartercore samples selected from drill holes series DG11 (30) and DBKA (36) as well the Trade Winds drill holes series TWDDH (127) were analyzed, along with selected standards and blanks.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.6 Verification Of The Detour Gold Drill Holes\n\nIn November 2012, SGS Geostat performed different statistical tests including lognormal student T-test and sign test on the data from the independent sampling program on the DG and DBKA series (total 66). SGS Geostat could not confirm the presence of any bias on the independent samples series from the Detour Gold samples. Overall, the assay results of the duplicate samples showed an average correlation ( $R^{2}=0.5$ for log values) with the original assays except for the samples with high gold values. The average grade of the Detour Gold sample series was $2.37 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ and for the SGS Geostat series, the average grade was $2.27 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. Fourteen of the 34 duplicate gold values $>1.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ returned values lower than the original samples. The 34 samples $>1.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ were not sufficient to statistically define an analytical bias for these values. A contributing factor to the discrepancy could be due to sampling quarter core rather than half core. However, these results showed the significant variability of the high-grade samples due to the nugget effect and the importance in the application of a conservative capping of the analytical composites used in Mineral Resource estimation. Significant variability was observed between the original and duplicate results. This behaviour in the variability duplicate samples was expected due to the significant nugget effect observed at the Detour Lake and West Detour deposits. The variability observed for the duplicate samples was in line with Detour Gold's QA/QC results for half core duplicates collected since 2007.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.7 Verification Of The Trade Winds Drill Holes\n\nIn July 2013, SGS Geostat performed different statistical tests including lognormal student T-test and sign test on the data from the independent sampling program on the TWDDH series drill holes (127). A total of 125 original and check fire assay results were retained to verify the same procedure. The sign test and student T-tests performed on the fire assay results showed a bias towards the original Trade Winds samples.\n\nOverall, the assay results of the duplicate samples sent to ALS Minerals returned values lower than the original values, with only 49 of the 125 fire assay results being over the original results. The fire assay results showed an average correlation ( $R^{2}=0.8$ for log values) with the original assays. The average grade of the Trade Winds sample series was $2.03 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ and SGS Geostat was $1.34 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. Sixteen of the 23 duplicate gold values between $1.0-5.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ returned values lower than the original samples. The sign testperformed on all 125 pairs (fire assay results) of values indicated a bias when considering the whole population. By sorting according to the original values of Trade Winds samples, there was a bias present for values $>9 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ (eight duplicates lower versus one duplicate higher). The selection of high-grade intervals may have influenced this result. SGS Geostat found that the Trade Winds sample grades (average) were almost always higher than those of the control data. This observation was systematic and significant enough to warrant further investigations. A contributing factor to the discrepancy could be attributed to duplicate assays being done on a smaller sample size coming from a quarter of the core instead of half core. SGS Geostat found that there were about as many Trade Winds data points (135,000 assays, $39 \\%$ of overall data) as Detour Gold (122,000 assays, $35 \\%$ of overall data) in the database, and the remainder came from prior historical drilling (92,000 assays, $26 \\%$ of overall data).\n\nIn order to assess the impact of the TW series data on Mineral Resource estimation, SGS Geostat carried out grade interpolations using the same procedures while removing the TW series. Results from this exercise indicated that the Mineral Resource estimate obtained was very similar, using the same gold cut-off grade.\nIt was SGS Geostat's opinion that the Trade Winds database was valid and acceptable for use in Mineral Resource estimation studies. However, they recommended that further monitoring be completed to investigate this potential bias on the estimation of Mineral Resources.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.8 Follow-Up On Trade Winds Drills Hole Verification\n\nIn late 2014, Detour Gold located and conducted test sampling on 63 original Trade Winds coarse rejects and pulps from the samples used by SGS Geostat in their 2012-2013 verification. Although the sample amount is limited, no significant bias was found. Fortyone samples were within $10 \\%$ of the original assays, 12 samples returned results values higher than $10 \\%$ of the original assays, and 10 samples returned values lower than the original assays.\n\nAn additional 218 original coarse rejects and pulps were located for Trade Winds (125 from TWDDH series) and Detour Gold ( 93 from DBKA series). Similar results were found. Of the 125 Trade Winds samples, 79 returned assays within $10 \\%$ of the original values, 25 returned higher assays and 21 returned lower assays than the original assays. Of the 93 Detour Gold DBKA samples, 63 returned assays within $10 \\%$ of the original values, 20 returned higher assays and 10 returned lower assays than the original assays.\n\nResults of the new assays from original coarse rejects and pulps from the TWDDH and DBKA drill series showed good reproducibility given the natural variability of gold due to high nugget effect. The results validated the original assays from pulps and rejects. However, it did not explain the discrepancy between original assay values and results obtained when submitting second half of remaining core from earlier Trade Winds core holes. The prior test used quarter-core and concentrated on high grade zones only, which may have biased the results. It was therefore decided that twinning some TWDDH wouldbe the best way to validate the original assay results. A twin drill hole program was completed in 2016 (see Section 10.9).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.1.9 Zone 58N Deposit Data Verification\n\n## Assay Certificate Verification\n\nThird-party consultants G Mining randomly selected several assay certificates in .pdf form from each year, and visually compared them with the assay flat file. In addition, the .csv files were cross-checked with the assay flat file using the sampleID as the key field and Excel formula.\n\nG Mining did not find any discrepancies and believed that the integrity of the drilling database as reviewed was high.\n\n## Intra-laboratory Check Assays\n\nIntra-laboratory check assays were undertaken at both Actlabs (2016) and SGS Cochrane (2017) for comparison with the results obtained from the routine laboratory (ALS Vancouver).\n\nIn 2016, 92 samples from 20 drill holes were analyzed at Actlabs, where the fine fraction pulp was sent and analyzed using the typical analysis route (fire assay followed by AA finish, with samples $>5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ being sent for gravimetrics where possible). Due to the extreme nugget effect observed at Zone 58 N , the fine fraction material was considered the most appropriate to test for intra-laboratory bias.\n\nIn 2017, 50 samples from five drill holes were analyzed at SGS Cochrane. The fine fraction showed very good repeatability between the two datasets. The 2016 results have a minor high bias to ALS Vancouver when samples are $<1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ and the 2017 results have a slight high bias to SGS Cochrane when samples are $<3 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 12.2 External Data Verification\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.2.1 Wood\n\nAgnico Eagle requested that third-party consultants Wood Canada Limited (Wood) perform a due-diligence audit of the Mineral Resource estimate (3 June, 2020 model) for the open pit. The audit was performed in five phases: geology, data evaluation, resource modelling, resource model validation and reporting, and a risk and opportunity assessment. Agnico Eagle personnel addressed items arising from the review at the end of each stage. Wood's opinion was that the overall model construction was reasonable and suitable for reporting Mineral Resources within the open pit and the Mineral Resource confidence classification was reasonable. The overall geological interpretation and estimation domains, used in conjunction with dynamic anisotropy, were shown to be a reasonable approach for the open pit model. The model, however, was not considered suitable for higher-grade undergroundmine planning or resource reporting. Wood recommended that a new dynamic anisotropy model for future high-grade underground models be constructed.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.2.2 Hard Rock Consulting\n\nDuring 2022, third-party consultants, Hard Rock Consulting, reviewed the 2022 Detour 2022 Resource Model Update that was completed by Kirkland Lake Gold's resource modelling personnel.\n\nData provided for the review included the 2020-2021 drill campaign database, domain solids, capping plan, variography, estimation plan, resource classification, and validation results.\n\nWhere issues arose as a result of the review, corrections were made by Kirkland Lake Gold in agreement with Hard Rock Consulting. No material issues were identified in the review.\n\nHard Rock Consulting concluded that overall, the estimation methodology used in conjunction with dynamic anisotropy provided a reasonable approach for the open pit model, and that the classification parameters for Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources are reasonable. Hard Rock Consulting noted, however, that pass 4, which was used to classify a portion of the Inferred category was optimistic, but agreed that the issue was not material since the tonnes and ounces classified in pass 4 were $<1 \\%$ of the total Mineral Resource estimate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 12.3 Kirkland Lake Gold/Agnico Eagle Verification Programs\n\nVerification programs include daily sample dispatch review and reporting, review, and approval of drill logs prior to uploading into the Fusion database, and review and authorization of received assay data by the Senior Database Administrator and the QP prior to uploading into the Fusion database.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.3.1 Drill Data Verification\n\nA complete verification and validation of analytical, geological, and survey information was completed for the data supporting this Report from January 2020 to 16 October, 2023.\nThe validation strategy included:\n\n- Confirming accurate information is present on the collar sheet including drill hole status, drill hole information, collar information, drilling information, logging information, hazard identification;\n- Adding new hole flags to make tracking of wedges, collar issues, and hole hazards easier;\n- Ensuring there are no gaps in the lithology entries including confirming that overburden and wedge re-starts are accurately captured;\n- Confirming that survey data were imported for all drill holes including restarts;- Confirming that the end-of-hole reported matched the core measured and lithology logged.\n\nA validation table was created verifying that all pertinent drill information had been reviewed. Data verification included:\n\n- Primary UTM, secondary mine grid, area, sub area, claim \\#, lease \\#;\n- Planned azimuth, planned dip, collar accuracy, survey instrument, survey date;\n- Surveyor, reason if abandoned, drilling started date, drilling completed date;\n- Extension date, extension depth, core storage, total \\# of boxes, notes;\n- Casing status (cemented-plugged-water), wedge information, reason if abandoned;\n- Hazards, no gaps lithology, final lithology depth, original end-of-hole, final survey depth;\n- Survey type, end-of-hole, survey imported, survey direction, survey @ 0 m ;\n- All assays imported, QC check, photos on network, validated, drill rig;\n- Other comments, wedge depth, wedge degree, start azimuth, end azimuth;\n- Start dip, end dip, degrees gained azimuth, degrees gained dip.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.3.2 Down-Hole Survey Verification\n\nIn 2021, Agnico Eagle completed down-hole surveying on 10 of the legacy drill holes using a Reflex Gyro Sprint-IQ instrument. These included four Trade Winds drill holes, two Placer Dome drill holes, and four Detour Gold drill holes. There were no significant differences noted between the original surveys and the 2021 re-surveys.\n\nSurface collar coordinates surveyed by Agnico Eagle using the Trimble SPS986 GNSS Rover were checked on 9 May, 2024 by Talbot. Collar coordinates of 24 holes used for underground resource estimation were re-surveyed. There were no significant differences noted between the original surveys and the re-surveys.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.3.3 Quality Assurance And Quality Control\n\nQA/QC protocols are in place to identify any irregularities with respect to the precision and accuracy of the data received from the analytical laboratories. The insertion of standard and blank materials into the sample dispatches to external laboratories allows for an external check on the accuracy and precision of the contract laboratories.\n\nThe primary concern and subsequent remediation identified by the protocols set in place by Agnico Eagle were primarily attributed to field errors associated with the insertion of standard and blank materials by core technicians. It was noted that the size and scope of the project, which involved core logging and cutting, sampling, and dispatching of an average of 700 samples per day, contributed to sample swaps which occurred periodically during the insertion of standards and blanks. In every case where a standard or blankfailure was determined by the Senior Database Administrator, the QP reviewed and provided direction as to whether to accept the results associated with the failure or to reassay the sample series associated with the failure.\n\nInitially Kirkland Lake Gold used six OREAS gold standards (see Section 11.7.3). To better determine whether analytical failure was a result of standard swaps or the analytical process, the supply of standard OREAS209 (acceptable range of 1.448-1.712 g/t Au) was exhausted before OREAS223 (acceptable range of $1.645-1.915 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ) was inserted. In cases where the standard and blank swaps were less evident, the sample series was reassayed.\n\nWhen failures were attributed to the laboratory performance, every fail was reviewed by the QP and direction was provided. The direction was recorded within the Fusion database.\n\nGenerally, when laboratory failures were evident but had analytical results close to the expected value for the specific standard or blank, the sample series associated with the failure were:\n\n- Re-assayed when it occurred within a mineral domain;\n- Accepted when it occurred in broad waste sections of the drill hole.\n\nFor all other laboratory failures that were not close to the expected standard or blank material values, the sample series associated with that sample were re-assayed.\n\nKirkland Lake Gold and Agnico Eagle produced monthly assay quality control and statistical reporting for each individual contract laboratory. Laboratory failures and field errors interpreted to be sample swaps were included in the statistics and monthly reports. The monthly reporting also summarized the precision and performance of each laboratory, including samples submitted, samples analyzed, statistical analysis for each laboratory, and analytical results for standards, blanks, and laboratory duplicates.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.3.4 Laboratory Check Assays\n\nThe purpose of the check assay program was to assess the accuracy and precision of the assay grades reported by the primary laboratory against those reported by the secondary laboratory using analytical techniques that were routinely used by the primary laboratory. The accuracy of the primary laboratory was determined through comparison with the check assay results.\n\nThe 2020-2023 check assay program consisted of re-analyzing approximately one out of every 15 samples sent with each dispatch. The laboratories used during the drill campaign were instructed to return 100 g splits of pulp material for every 15th sample sent. The pulps were then sorted by on-site Agnico Eagle staff and sent to one of the other primary laboratories to be assayed again using the same analytical techniques as the original laboratory.\n\nStarting in 2023, ALS was the sole primary laboratory. During February and March 2023, AGAT was used as the secondary check laboratory. As of May 2023, Bureau Veritas was the sole secondary laboratory.Between January 2020 and 16 October, 2023, a total of 32,764 check assay results had been received.\n\nAll four laboratories performed well in terms of QA/QC, with Z-scores (number of standard deviations above or below the mean) between $94 \\%$ (SGS) and 98\\% (AGAT, ALS). Results for all standards were biased below expected values for AGAT, although 98-99\\% fell within three standard deviations. SGS had a similar bias with between 91-97\\% of results falling within three standard deviations, whereas ALS fared slightly better with 96-100\\% falling within three standard deviations. Broadly speaking, ALS also had the best distribution above and below expected for two standards, OREAS 217 and OREAS 216b.\n\nPreparation and pulp duplicates were acceptably clustered for most laboratories, with AGAT slightly edging out the others and SGSs distribution being a little looser than the others. Sample shipments to SGS were halted part-way through the program due to long turnaround times, not QA/QC issues.\n\nFor the check assay program, one out of every 15 samples were re-analyzed at either ALS or Actlabs using the same analytical techniques used for primary assays. Although some results were still pending at the time of this Report, the overall grade distribution for the available re-assays was good.\n\nStandard failures flagged during the import procedure were subject to documented QA/QC protocols and referred to a QP for approval prior to any action being taken and failures were documented in a QA/QC action table within the Fusion database. Several failure patterns across multiple laboratories were flagged by QA/QC personnel and verified through QA/QC charts. After being traced back to standard swaps during the sample process, the underlying issues were quickly addressed by site personnel.\n\nStandard distribution and bias continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis and any concerns are communicated to laboratories and the QP as required. Outliers generated by sample swap errors are communicated to senior site personnel and the QP and are addressed at the source. These errors do not have a significant impact on overall standard performance, with observed and expected values matching well for all standards.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 12.4 Verification Completed By The Qps\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.4.1 Ms. Dyane Duquette\n\nMs. Duquette has performed site visits (see Section 2.4).\nMs. Duquette supervised the preparation of the Mineral Resource estimates and the supporting data as summarized in this Report.\n\nShe discussed the exploration data and basis for reasonableness of these data with Mr. Steven Gray, P.Geo., the Detour Lake Operations Exploration Manager. Mr. Gray had undertaken verification that included site visits, review of geological data collection and checks that the QA/QC procedures used by Agnico Eagle are consistent with standard industry practices. Ms. Duquette considers that a reasonable level of verification has beencompleted and that no material issues have been left unidentified from the programs undertaken. The data are acceptable to be used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.\n\nMs. Duquette discussed the Mineral Resource estimation procedures, considerations of reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction, and tabulated resource estimates for the Detour Lake deposit with Mr. Juan Figueroa, P.Geo., the Manager of Mineral Resources at Detour Lake Operations. Mr. Figueroa had undertaken verification that included reviewing the company and historical database sample and assaying protocols, QA/QC, surveying, and database validations. He considered that these databases were representative of the mineralization and appropriate for use in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation. Mr. Figueroa also conducted his own validations, including:\n\n- Review of previous database audits and QA/QC reports;\n- Supervising the work done to audit the current drillhole database program\n\nMs. Duquette considers that a reasonable level of verification has been completed and that no material issues have been left unidentified from the programs undertaken. The database reviewed is acceptable to be used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.\n\nShe discussed the Mineral Resource estimation procedures, considerations of reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction, and tabulated resource estimates for the Zone 58N deposit with Mr. Sandeep Prakash, P.Geo., Senior Resource Geologist. Mr. Prakash had undertaken verification that included reviewing the drilling data, geology, resource modelling, resource model parameters and resource classification for the 58N deposit. Ms. Duquette considers that the Mineral Resource estimation methodology used by third-party consultants G Mining for the 58N deposit are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of Mineral Resource reporting.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.4.2 Mr. Andre Leite\n\nMr. Leite completed a site visit (see Section 2.4), during which he examined data as outlined in Section 2.4. He has also participated Mineral Reserve preparation, conducted reviews of mill and mine production plans, tailing construction, permitting strategies, and financial analyses. Mr. Leite considers that a reasonable level of verification has been completed and that no material issues have been left unidentified from the programs undertaken. The information reviewed is acceptable to be used in Mineral Reserve estimation, mine planning, and supports the economic analysis underlying the Mineral Reserves.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 12.4.3 Ms. Julie Bélanger\n\nMs. Bélanger has performed site visits (see Section 2.4).\nMs. Bélanger reviewed the underground project economics results used in the 2024 PEA in Section 24; these included production assumptions, operating costs assumption, initial capital, and sustaining capital cost assumptions. She verified that the key inputs to the capital and operating costs presented in Section 24 were acceptable for use in support ofMineral Resource estimates assuming underground mining methods. She also reviewed the underground mine design and underground mining sequence as used in the 2024 PEA."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 13.1 Introduction\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine process plant was constructed in 2012, started operations in 2013, and has been operating since. The plant design was based on metallurgical testwork completed during pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, conducted from 2009-2010. Most of the metallurgical testing was completed at SGS Lakefield Research Limited in Ontario (SGS Lakefield) with follow-up testwork (lead nitrate and oxygen control) carried out on-site by site personnel.\n\nRecoveries from Detour Main Pit have been in line with the feasibility study ( $91.2 \\%$ ) while milling rates have exceeded plant design predictions in that study.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.2 Historical Metallurgical Testwork\n\nMetallurgical testwork completed as part of the 2009 pre-feasibility study included mineralogical examination; gravity recovery tests, including gravity recoverable gold (GRG) tests; cyanide leach tests on gravity tailings; grade variability testing; barren solution recycle testing; cyanide destruction tests; preparation of tailings for chemical and physical characterization and environmental testing; and environmental testwork.\n\nDuring the 2010 feasibility study, tests focused on project optimization, and included evaluation of gold recovery versus grind size, use of oxygen in leach and crushing and grinding studies.\n\nExtensive plant testwork proved the benefit of leaching with high oxygen rates and lead nitrate. Four full grinding circuit surveys were completed by Detour personnel and modelled by third-party consultants using JKSimMet to assist with grinding circuit optimizations and characterization.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.3 Detour Lake/West Detour/Saddle Zone Testwork Programs And Results\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.1 Comminution\n\nA total of 132 HQ core samples were used for comminution tests on eight domains within the Detour Lake deposit. Tests included semi-autogenous grind (SAG) mill comminution (SMC) tests for A and b parameters, drop weight index (DWi), crushing work index (CWi), Bond ball mill work index (BWi), Bond rod mill work index (RWi) and abrasion index (Ai). Specific gravity tests were also conducted, using wax immersion, pycnometer, and SMC methods. The results of these tests were confirmed through various grinding survey campaigns. A total of 61 core samples from West Detour were subject to comminution tests and 25 samples of the Saddle zones were tested in 2022.Table 13-1 summarizes the comminution testwork results for the main Detour Lake deposit. Table 13-2 provides a comparison between the West Detour, Saddle Zone, and Detour Lake Main zones within the Detour Lake deposit. Results indicate that mineralization from West Detour and Saddle is softer in terms of RWi and BWi and less abrasive than the mineralization of the main Detour Lake zone.\n\nNo metallurgical testwork was completed on the Saddle Zone as it lies in between the West and Main zones, as the results for these were very similar in terms of recovery characterization.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.2 Grinding Circuit Simulation\n\nThe grindability results from the comminution testing were used to conduct JKSimMet simulations of different SAG mill circuit configurations and operational variables (circulating load, eightieth percentile ( $\\mathrm{P}_{90}$ ), etc.). A SAG-ball-crushing (SABC) grinding circuit configuration was selected for the process plant. In the design, the feed to the SAG mill was subjected to primary and secondary crushing to reduce the feed size to the SAG mill due to the high ore hardness. The grinding circuit design basis was reviewed by third-party consultants Ausenco and SAG Design and was deemed appropriate for the hardness of the ores that the Detour Lake plant would process.\n\nOnce the circuit was operational, this model was updated four times with crushing/grinding circuit surveys that served as the basis for circuit optimization.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.3 Gravity Gold Recovery\n\nThe results of the gravity recovery tests performed at the feasibility study stage indicated that gravity recovery was a key component of the milling process for Detour Lake. This was verified with plant data where the plant recovery is clearly influenced by gravity recovery (Figure 13-1).\n\nDuring the feasibility study, laboratory testwork recoveries varied from $30-45 \\%$ (25-75 ${ }^{\\text {th }}$ percentile) to as much as $70 \\%$. Similar tests for the western portion of the deposit indicated that gravity recovery ranged from $20.1-80.4 \\%$ for the samples tested. This variability was taken to be consistent with the nature of free gold in some samples and more disseminated in other samples. No marked differences in the respective responses were noted between the Main and West areas of the deposit.\n\nFigure 13-2 is showing the testwork recoveries from the feasibility study. Table 13-3 shows the historical plant gravity recovery. Averaging about $25 \\%$ historically, it is believed the gravity recovery can be increased. This can be substantiated by the fact that the gravity circuit is fed from cyclone feed material vs ball-mill discharge as per the original design.\nOperational issues prevented feeding the gravity circuit with ball-mill discharge material. However, a new design was developed where cyclone underflow will now feed the gravity circuit. This is expected to increase the gravity recovery as the grade of the cyclone underfeed is much higher than the cyclone feed.Table 13-1: $\\quad$ Comminution Testwork, Detour Lake Main Zone\n\n| Statistics | Specific Gravity <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{c m}^{3}\\right)$ |  |  | SMC <br> Test <br> $(\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{b})$ | CWi <br> $(\\mathbf{k W h} / \\mathbf{t})$ | RWi <br> $(\\mathbf{k W h} / \\mathbf{t})$ | BWi <br> @150 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ <br> $(\\mathbf{k W h} / \\mathbf{t})$ | $\\mathbf{A i}$ <br> $(\\mathbf{g})$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n|  | Wax | Pycnometer | SMC |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Average | 2.89 | 2.89 | 2.92 | 26.0 | 14.2 | 18.0 | 14.3 | 0.421 |\n| Minimum | 2.49 | 2.67 | 2.72 | 53.1 | 5.2 | 12.0 | 9.1 | 0.08 |\n| $10^{\\text {th }}$ percentile | 2.74 | 2.81 | 2.80 | 30.2 | 9.9 | 15.9 | 11.2 | 0.238 |\n| $25^{\\text {th }}$ percentile | 2.82 | 2.84 | 2.88 | 27.5 | 11.9 | 17.2 | 12.7 | 0.365 |\n| Median | 2.90 | 2.90 | 2.94 | 25.7 | 14.8 | 18.0 | 14.3 | 0.484 |\n| $75^{\\text {th }}$ percentile | 2.98 | 2.93 | 2.98 | 24.3 | 16.9 | 18.9 | 15.5 | 0.54 |\n| $90^{\\text {th }}$ percentile | 3.01 | 2.98 | 3.01 | 23.4 | 19.7 | 19.9 | 16.5 | 0.544 |\n| Maximum | 3.19 | 3.09 | 3.10 | 22.5 | 25.6 | 22.7 | 20.1 | 0.548 |\n\nTable 13-2: $\\quad$ Comminution Testwork: Detour Lake Main vs West Detour vs Saddle Zones\n\n| Deposit | JKTech <br> Parameters |  | Relative Density |  | SG | Work Indices |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | SMC <br> Test <br> $(\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{b})$ | DWI <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{k W h} / \\mathbf{m}^{3}\\right)$ | Wax <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{c m}^{3}\\right)$ | SMC <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{c m}^{3}\\right)$ | Pycnometer <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{c m}^{3}\\right)$ | CWi <br> $(\\mathbf{k W h} / \\mathbf{t})$ | RWi <br> $(\\mathbf{k W h} / \\mathbf{t})$ | $\\mathbf{B W i}$ <br> $(\\mathbf{k W h} / \\mathbf{t})$ | $\\mathbf{A i}$ |\n| Detour Lake | 24.3 | 11.4 | 2.98 | 2.98 | 2.93 | 16.9 | 18.9 | 15.5 | 0.54 |\n| West Detour | 24.8 | 11.6 | 2.98 | 2.97 | 2.99 | 16.4 | 17.1 | 13.2 | 0.39 |\n| Saddle Zone | 25.5 | 11.7 | N/A | 2.95 | N/A | 16.4 | N/A | 11.4 | 0.37 |Figure 13-1: Plant Recovery versus Gravity Recovery\n![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Kirkland Lake Gold, 2020.\n\nFigure 13-2: Feasibility Study Testwork Recovery Predictions\n![img-29.jpeg](img-29.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Kirkland Lake Gold, 2020.Table 13-3: Historical Gravity Recovery\n\n| Year | Gravity Gold Recovery <br> (\\%) |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| 2013 | 14.5 |\n| 2014 | 22.7 |\n| 2015 | 24.6 |\n| 2016 | 24.1 |\n| 2017 | 19.7 |\n| 2018 | 21.0 |\n| 2019 | 26.2 |\n| 2020 | 28.4 |\n| 2021 | 26.2 |\n| 2022 | 21.6 |\n| 2023 | 24.7 |\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.4 Leach Test Work\n\nExtensive testwork (leach profiles, final tails re-leach, gold leach kinetics tests) were completed in the plant and in the laboratory to improve recovery. Plant recovery has gone up significantly from 2019 as a result of this work (Table 13-4).\n\nCircuit modifications to improve oxygen diffusion, reduced leach densities and lead nitrate addition had a significant impact on maintaining and improving recovery in the leaching circuit at the higher throughput rate. The need to add extra leach tanks has been alleviated by these improvements.\n\nThe plant conducts weekly final tails re-leach of the final leach tails to establish potential gold losses. The final tails are re-leached with a very high cyanide concentration ( $1,000 \\mathrm{ppm}$ ). After this test is done, the final tails sample is then re-ground for seven minutes in a small laboratory ball-mill. The grind fineness then improves from $70 \\%$ passing $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ to $80 \\%$ passing $75 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. The ore is then re-leached for eight hours at a very high cyanide concentration ( $1,000 \\mathrm{ppm}$ ). Results for 2018-2023 are illustrated in Figure 13-4 and summarized in Table 13-5.\n\nThe potential to improve the recovery through better grind fineness therefore exists and validates the feasibility test work (Figure 13-5). It is also believed that the gold gained through the intensive leaching represents the potential gold lost due to gravity recovery.Table 13-4: Plant Recoveries, 2013-2023\n\n| Year | Recovery <br> (\\%) | Head Grade <br> (g/t Au) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 2013 | 86.2 | 0.750 |\n| 2014 | 90.7 | 0.884 |\n| 2015 | 90.9 | 0.876 |\n| 2016 | 89.2 | 0.902 |\n| 2017 | 89.6 | 0.929 |\n| 2018 | 90.1 | 1.038 |\n| 2019 | 92.1 | 0.922 |\n| 2020 | 91.3 | 0.834 |\n| 2021 | 91.7 | 1.000 |\n| 2022 | 92.0 | 0.973 |\n| 2023 | 90.9 | 0.912 |\n\nFigure 13-3: Average 2023 Leach Circuit Profile\n![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2023.Figure 13-4: Tails Re-leach Results 2020-2023\n![img-31.jpeg](img-31.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2023.\n\nTable 13-5: Recovery Gains, Intensive Re-Leach\n\n| Year | Potential Gain in Recovery <br> Intensive Re-Leach <br> (\\%) | Potential Gain in Recovery <br> Total with Regrind <br> (\\%) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 2020 | 1.22 | 2.23 |\n| 2021 | 1.15 | 3.26 |\n| 2022 | 2.13 | 3.64 |\n| 2023 | 1.53 | 4.75 |Figure 13-5: Gold in Tails (g/t) vs. Pao, Detour Lake Samples\n![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Detour Gold, 2011.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.5 Impact Of Copper On Recovery And Cyanide Consumption\n\nThe Detour Lake mineralization contains copper concentrations varying from $0.025-0.08 \\%$ with copper dissolution in leach varying from 5-15\\%. Metallurgical testwork results showed that these extraction rates provided leach solution grades normally varying from 20$60 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{L}$ in copper content, with outliers in the $80-280 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{L}$ in grade variation tests when gold grades varied from $2.0-9.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ). Data obtained from the process plant are in line with these laboratory observations. It was found that temperature control was the key to limiting copper dissolution. Leach density set-points were dropped to minimize the temperature. With the increase plant throughput, the slurry temperature has dropped over the years which resulted in lower reagent consumption of lime, cyanide, $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and lead nitrate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.6 Carbon-In-Pulp Solution Losses\n\nThe carbon-in-pulp (CIP) solution losses have been maintained to historical levels while increasing throughput. Historical solution losses are illustrated in Table 13-6.Table 13-6: CIP Solution Grades, 2017-2023\n\n| Year | CIP Tails Solutions <br> $(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{A u})$ |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| 2017 | 0.010 |\n| 2018 | 0.013 |\n| 2019 | 0.007 |\n| 2020 | 0.008 |\n| 2021 | 0.012 |\n| 2022 | 0.010 |\n| 2023 | 0.011 |\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.7 Carbon Losses Minimization\n\nCarbon losses were estimated in the feasibility study to be at $0.4 \\%$ gold loss in the final tails and are another area where gold losses can be minimized. Operating data has shown this number to be higher; closer to $1.5 \\%$. Capital expenditures to reduce this number are planned, such as replacement of carbon pumps, improved carbon sizing, and reduced carbon gold loading.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.8 Cyanide Destruction\n\nCyanide destruction uses the $\\mathrm{SO}_{2} /$ air method. The current plant performance is in line with the feasibility study test work. A fourth detox tank has been built to sustain the $28 \\mathrm{Mt} /$ year throughput rate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.9 West Detour\n\nGravity tailings testwork on West Detour samples was conducted to assess sensitivity to grind size and sodium cyanide ( NaCN ) concentration. Using $0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L} \\mathrm{NaCN}$, gravity + cyanidation recovery was measured to vary from $88.3-98.7 \\%$. Recovery was found to increase with finer grind size as the main Detour deposit. Cyanidation recovery response to head grade for West Detour indicated that the grade variability composites were also similar to those from Detour Lake. From a leaching perspective, no adverse effects were predicted when in blending West Detour mineralization with the ore from the main Detour Lake deposit as plant feed.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.3.10 Zone 58N Testwork\n\nTwo testwork phases, Phase I in 2016 with Phase II in 2017, were conducted on 31 samples. A similar metallurgical testing approach was used and aimed at evaluating if the existing processing flowsheet was compatible with processing of Zone 58N material.\n\nWhen combining the gold recovered from both the gravity concentrate and the leached Knelson gravity tailing material, the overall gold recovery ranged from $97.5 \\%$ to $>99 \\%$.In was concluded that the composite samples tested are amenable to the gravity separation/gravity tailing cyanidation flowsheet as currently practiced in the existing plant.\n\nThe total calculated gold head grades and recoveries (adding all units of operations) for all composites samples exceeded $97.5 \\%$ (Figure 13-6).\n\nThis testing supported that material from Zone 58 N is amenable to the existing plant flowsheet, which already incorporates gravity separation followed by intensive cyanidation of the gravity concentrate and cyanidation of the gravity tailings.\n\nThe calculated gold head grades varied from $0.75-35.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.4 Open Pit Recovery Model\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.4.1 Recovery Equations\n\nThe recovery equation for the LOM is derived from 2019-2020 plant data (Figure 13-7), and no changes were made for the LOM plan in this Report as the model appears not to have changed.\n\nThe current recovery equation is:\n\n- Gold Recovery $(\\%)=(0.8787+0.0427 \\times \\mathrm{HG}) \\times 100$ where HG represent the head grade in $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\nThis relationship includes allowances for gold solution losses occurring at the processing facility. When using the block model, recovery is capped at $90 \\%$ on the low side and $95 \\%$ on the high side. At the end of the mine life, when low-grade stockpiles will be reclaimed, the recovery was put at $88 \\%$. This is due to the lack of historical data for these stockpiles to populate the model.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.4.2 Lom Recovery Forecasts\n\nThe LOM recovery will follow the 2019-2020 model which is still accurate. Laboratory testwork performed by SGS indicated that the West Detour deposit has a similar mineralogy to that of the Detour Lake deposit with similar recoveries. The same recovery assumptions are therefore used for the West Detour mineralization as for the Main Pit. The Saddle zone recovery is also expected to be using the same assumption since it lies in between the two main deposit zones.Figure 13-6: Grade-Recovery Relationship, Zone 58N\n![img-33.jpeg](img-33.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Kirkland Lake Gold, 2020.\n\nFigure 13-7: Recovery versus Head Grades, 2019-2020\n![img-34.jpeg](img-34.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Kirkland Lake Gold, 2020.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 13.4.3 Recovery Improvement Initiatives\n\nThere are recovery improvement initiatives in the LOM to maintain the recovery rates at the current levels while increasing the plant throughput. These initiatives are:\n\n- Grind size fineness improvement;\n- Ball size optimization;\n- Process control improvements;\n- Increase ball-mill power;\n- Reduced hardness from Detour West and Saddle Zone;\n- Balancing the load between the two ball-mills;\n- Reduced ball-mill transfer size by reducing grates size to 60 mm from 70 mm and reducing the SAG discharge screen openings from 9.5 mm to 8.0 mm ;\n- Ball-mill density control;\n- CIP solution losses reduction;\n- Reduce carbon gold loading by treating more carbon per day;\n- Improved carbon management;\n- Improved regeneration kilns temperature;\n- Gravity recovery improvement;\n- Leach reactor cycle improvement;\n- Conversion of gravity circuit feed from cyclone feed to cyclone underflow;\n- Carbon losses minimization;\n- CIP feed screen with double deck to avoid rocks being mixed with carbon;\n- New loaded carbon pump with recessed impeller;\n- Better carbon screening and pre-attrition;\n- Daily monitoring of leach performance and lead nitrate/cyanide dosage using electrochemistry probe.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.5 Proposed Underground Recovery Model\n\nThe recovery equation for the underground mineralization is derived from 2019-2020 plant data.The current gold recovery equation is:\n\n- Gold recovery $(\\%)=100 \\times(0.8787+0.0427 \\times \\mathrm{HG})$\nwhere HG represents the head grade in $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\nThis relationship was compared to 2020-2022 operating data, and indicates that the equation remains valid for predicting the recovery for mineralization that could be mined using underground methods. It is therefore assumed that the underground material will respond in a similar manner to open pit ore, and the mineralization mined by the two different mining methods can be blended.\n\nCapping for high- and low-grade material is as follows:\n\n- $95 \\%$ gold recovery for high-grade $>1.65 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au} ;$\n- $90 \\%$ gold recovery for high-grade $<0.60 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$,\n\nThis relationship includes allowances for gold solution losses occurring at the process facility.\n\nAs the cut-off grade for the underground material is fixed at $1.80 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ (incremental cut-off grade at $1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ ), the expected gold recovery should be capped at $95 \\%$. It is more accurate to evaluate the gold extraction using the mill feed grade combining open pit and underground material.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.6 Metallurgical Variability\n\nThe variability of the ore in the Main Detour Pit is related to the talc, copper, and sulphur content. The talc zone is mainly located on the south end of the Main Pit while copper and sulphur are present throughout the pit in various quantities. High-talc ore are soft and will process faster. High-talc ore used to impact recovery in the past and talc ores were limited to $15 \\%$ of plant feed. It was found that recovery could be maintained with very high lead nitrate dosage rates. Processing of $40 \\%$ talc ore in feed in 2020 yielded similar recoveries as non-talc ore.\n\nSulphur content also impacts recovery and blending strategies to avoid feeding the plant with ores over $2 \\%$ sulphur are in place and have worked successfully.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 13.7 Deleterious Elements\n\nCopper is an element that impact cyanide and $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ consumption. It is managed by blending if too high, and by controlling the slurry temperature to the leach feed. To avoid the copper plating on the carbon, a control strategy on the cyanide/copper ratio is in place. The installation of a cooling tower for the reclaim water is being considered and should reduce the amount of copper being dissolved."

    "text": "The 2024 Mineral Resource estimate consists of four block models: two above the Mineral Reserve pit, one below the Mineral Reserve pit, and one for Zone 58N. The models above the Mineral Reserve pit were estimated for open pit mining and used for Mineral Reserve estimation. These block models used only low-grade mineralization domains and were split along an arbitrary north-south limit at 590,300E. The east and west models above the Mineral Reserves pit were estimated in December 2020 and December 2023, respectively. The block model below the Mineral Reserve pit was completed in March 2024, after the open pit Mineral Reserves were estimated. It was prepared to support estimation of Mineral Resources assuming open pit and underground mining methods, and includes high-grade and low-grade mineralized domains. The block model for Zone 58N was completed in September 2018 by third-party consultants, G Mining Services Inc. (G Mining).\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 14.1 Detour Lake Mine\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.1 Introduction\n\nMineral Resources are estimated for mineralization potentially amenable to open pit and underground mining methods. The outlines of the estimated areas are shown in Figure 14-1.\n\nThe drill hole database supporting the Mineral Resource estimate has a cut-off date of 16 October, 2023. The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of 31 March, 2024, the date used for mining depletion.\n\nDifferent block models were used for the Mineral Resource estimate above and below the Mineral Reserves pit design. Below the Mineral Reserves pit, the model incorporated Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit and underground mining methods. Mineralized domains were modelled using a high-grade corridor for those Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods, and a low-grade zone that was considered potentially amenable to both open pit and underground mining methods.\n\nThe block model informing the Mineral Resources below the Mineral Reserves pit was completed in March 2024. The Mineral Resources above the Mineral Reserves pit only used the low-grade mineralized domains. This model was updated in December 2023 to the west of 590,300E, and in 2020 to the east of this limit. The model above the Mineral Reserves pit was used to estimate Mineral Reserves, as explained in Section 15 of this Report. All the models used the same drill hole database and mineralized wireframes (except for the high-grade corridor). However, the interpolation parameters were slightly different from one model to another.Figure 14-1: Location Map, Mineral Resource Estimate\n![img-35.jpeg](img-35.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. Main-West and North reserve pits and underground stopes outside resource pit. Plan view looking down at 240 m elevation.The lithology and structural models and the estimation domains were built in Leapfrog Geo 2023.2.1, the Mineral Resource estimates were completed using Datamine Studio RM ver. 1.13.202.0, and Supervisor V. 8.15.1 was used to carry out the geostatistical analysis, variography and top-cut studies.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.2 Drill Hole Database\n\nDrilling supporting estimation is discussed in Section 10.\nDrill holes with pending assay results were excluded from Mineral Resource estimation. If a 2020-2023 drill hole did not reach its intended target depth or deviated too far from its intended orientation, that drill hole was abandoned and excluded from the database supporting resource estimation.\nAll drill holes in the Mineral Resource database with non-sampled intervals had gold values replaced with $0.001 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$, on the assumption that these intervals did not show indicators of mineralization. Drill hole wedges, starting at a certain depth below the parent hole were coded with WDG on it, and were excluded from the estimate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.3 Geological Interpretation And Modelling\n\nEleven low-grade domains captured the material $>0.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ in the models above and below the Mineral Reserves pit. In the model below the Mineral Reserves pit, in addition to the low-grade domains, seven mineralized domains containing most of the high-grade corridors were defined. All of these were located inside the low-grade domains. There are 43 narrow high-grade zones (Figure 14-2, Figure 14-3, and Table 14-1).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.4 Estimation Domains\n\nThe mineralized zones and domains were constructed using the methodology of implicit modelling by selecting sample intervals in Leapfrog Geo, which were then used to construct wireframe volume-solids. While the geological continuity was considered in domaining, grade along strike was determined to be the most reliable criteria in domain construction.\nEstimation domains were originally clipped to exclude areas with very low gold grades, and were then subdivided into zones based on the wireframe grade continuity. Individual wireframes within an estimation domain represent different zones (refer to Table 14-1).\nIn the model below the Mineral Reserves pit, the high-grade zone wireframes were modeled from lower limits of the deposit to the reserve pit design, and were extended to surface when it was possible. The high-grade zones were constructed to enclose material above a threshold grade of $0.7 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. Eleven low-grade zone wireframes were created surrounding the high-grade zones. Low-grade zones were modelled using a threshold grade of $0.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. These wireframes were used to flag blocks with a zone code.\nAn additional zone was created to define the overburden material (zone code 0). The material outside these zones was assigned with the zone 100 (waste). The zone wireframes were subject to a Boolean analysis against the overburden to create an exact fit. These wireframes were renamed as \"lode\" wireframes and used for resource estimation.Figure 14-2: Modelled Domains\n![img-36.jpeg](img-36.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.Figure 14-3: Example Cross-Section High- and Low-Grade Domains\n![img-37.jpeg](img-37.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.

This solid was filled with blocks for the block model estimation and given a block code of \"0\".\n\nAn open pit mining depletion surface was prepared by the Survey Department as at 31 March, 2024, which was used to deplete mined areas.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.7 Compositing\n\nSample intervals were split into 0.1 m intervals, coded with zone wireframes, and composited. Compositing was downhole, respecting the contacts defined by the zone wireframes.\n\nBelow the Mineral Reserves pit a 2 m downhole composite was selected because the 2 m interval is twice the most frequent sample interval length (about $80 \\%$ of all samples are 1 m in length), and because at least two composites will fit in each parent block in the block model.\n\nAbove the Mineral Reserves pit the composite length of 5 m , used in previous estimates, was retained.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.8 Grade Capping/Outlier Restriction\n\nCapping was performed on a zone-by-zone basis using 2 m and 5 m downhole composites.\nOutlier gold grades within the mineral zones were identified using a variety of statistical plots, including histograms, cumulative probability plots, and cumulative metal charts within Snowden Supervisor software.\n\nTable 14-2, Table 14-3, and Table 14-4 summarize the mineral zone capping limits with descriptive statistics for the global dataset.\n\nAfter applying capping the coefficient of variation was reduced from 3-10 to 1.6-3, with metal lost under $10 \\%$ in most cases. This indicated that the database was appropriate for interpolation with ordinary kriging (OK) if care was taken to minimize the over smoothing of the estimates and judicious selection of the estimation parameters.Table 14-2: Capping Limits by Mineralized Zone, Model Below Mineral Reserves Pit\n\n| Domain | Zone Code | \\# <br> Records | Cut <br> Value <br> Au <br> (g/t) | \\# <br> Samples <br> Cut | \\% <br> Assays <br> Capped | CV | Percentile | Metal <br> Loss <br> (\\%) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| DOM 51 <br> (HG) | 5100 | 20,177 | 52 | 38 | 0.19 | 2.01 | 99.80 | 1.40 |\n|  | 5101 | 31,037 | 40 | 56 | 0.18 | 1.95 | 99.80 | 2.50 |\n|  | 5102 | 3,415 | 30 | 11 | 0.32 | 2.33 | 99.70 | 5.30 |\n|  | 5103 | 8,105 | 30 | 26 | 0.32 | 2.22 | 99.70 | 3.10 |\n|  | 5104 | 14,528 | 45 | 18 | 0.12 | 2.07 | 99.90 | 1.00 |\n|  | 5105 | 1,341 | 18 | 12 | 0.89 | 1.57 | 99.10 | 4.30 |\n|  | 5106 | 346 | 11 | 3 | 0.87 | 1.94 | 99.10 | 6.80 |\n| DOM 52 <br> (HG) | 5200 | 18,313 | 40 | 49 | 0.27 | 2.32 | 99.70 | 7.30 |\n|  | 5201 | 2,878 | 16 | 22 | 0.76 | 1.84 | 99.20 | 5.90 |\n|  | 5202 | 13,142 | 33 | 21 | 0.16 | 2.27 | 99.80 | 2.70 |\n|  | 5203 | 7,840 | 18 | 17 | 0.22 | 1.86 | 99.80 | 2.40 |\n| DOM 53 <br> (HG) | 5303 | 1,492 | 15 | 10 | 0.67 | 1.70 | 99.30 | 4.90 |\n|  | 5304 | 525 | 20 | 4 | 0.76 | 2.27 | 99.20 | 22.80 |\n|  | 5305 | 7,117 | 55 | 7 | 0.10 | 2.57 | 99.90 | 2.60 |\n|  | 5306 | 2,076 | 20 | 8 | 0.39 | 1.72 | 99.60 | 3.30 |\n|  | 5307 | 4,436 | 45 | 9 | 0.20 | 2.51 | 99.80 | 15.50 |\n|  | 5308 | 5,192 | 18 | 13 | 0.25 | 1.76 | 99.80 | 15.90 |\n|  | 5309 | 5,719 | 55 | 5 | 0.09 | 2.66 | 99.90 | 6.50 |\n|  | 5310 | 2,166 | 12 | 7 | 0.32 | 1.64 | 99.70 | 22.00 |\n|  | 5311 | 628 | 8 | 7 | 1.11 | 1.52 | 98.90 | 17.20 |\n|  | 5312 | 530 | 9 | 8 | 1.51 | 1.36 | 98.50 | 9.10 |\n|  | 5313 | 957 | 9 | 6 | 0.63 | 1.60 | 99.40 | 3.10 |\n|  | 5314 | 607 | 7 | 5 | 0.82 | 1.39 | 99.20 | 3.80 |\n| DOM 54 <br> (HG) | 5400 | 3,937 | 60 | 4 | 0.10 | 2.61 | 99.90 | 11.00 |\n|  | 5401 | 664 | 15 | 4 | 0.60 | 1.76 | 99.40 | 21.50 |\n|  | 5402 | 682 | 17 | 4 | 0.59 | 2.19 | 99.40 | 9.70 |\n|  | 5403 | 228 | 10 | 3 | 1.32 | 2.32 | 98.70 | 21.90 |\n| DOM 55 <br> (HG) | 5500 | 5,967 | 65 | 8 | 0.13 | 3.10 | 99.90 | 4.60 |\n|  | 5501 | 2,899 | 25 | 4 | 0.14 | 2.40 | 99.90 | 14.80 |\n|  | 5502 | 579 | 8 | 2 | 0.35 | 1.85 | 99.70 | 9.80 |\n|  | 5503 | 3,486 | 25 | 8 | 0.23 | 2.34 | 99.80 | 3.00 |\n|  | 5504 | 1,329 | 35 | 5 | 0.38 | 3.20 | 99.60 | 9.10 |\n|  | 5505 | 976 | 15 | 6 | 0.61 | 2.18 | 99.40 | 3.20 |\n|  | 5506 | 478 | 13 | 3 | 0.63 | 2.00 | 99.40 | 6.40 || Domain | Zone Code | \\# <br> Records | Cut <br> Value <br> Au <br> (g/t) | \\# <br> Samples <br> Cut | \\% <br> Assays <br> Capped | CV | Percentile | Metal <br> Loss <br> (\\%) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 5507 | 906 | 10 | 7 | 0.77 | 1.78 | 99.20 | 7.60 |\n| DOM 56 <br> (HG) | 5600 | 2,337 | 18 | 3 | 0.13 | 2.17 | 99.90 | 2.70 |\n|  | 5601 | 2,572 | 10 | 7 | 0.27 | 1.90 | 99.70 | 7.20 |\n|  | 5602 | 2,802 | 18 | 9 | 0.32 | 2.63 | 99.70 | 4.90 |\n|  | 5603 | 1,221 | 18 | 5 | 0.41 | 2.92 | 99.60 | 18.50 |\n|  | 5604 | 247 | 4 | 4 | 1.62 | 1.58 | 98.40 | 5.80 |\n|  | 5605 | 473 | 10 | 2 | 0.42 | 2.76 | 99.60 | 14.30 |\n| DOM 57 <br> (HG) | 5700 | 1,451 | 15 | 3 | 0.21 | 2.21 | 99.80 | 5.60 |\n|  | 5701 | 1,338 | 18 | 5 | 0.37 | 2.02 | 99.60 | 2.50 |\n| Low-grade domains | Zone 1 | 3,471 | 9 | 10 | 0.29 | 2.75 | 99.70 | 10.50 |\n|  | Zone 2 | 1,062 | 3 | 4 | 0.38 | 1.91 | 99.70 | 15.30 |\n|  | Zone 3 | 3,322 | 9 | 9 | 0.27 | 3.72 | 99.70 | 13.70 |\n|  | Zone 4 | 1,040 | 2.25 | 7 | 0.67 | 1.85 | 99.30 | 6.30 |\n|  | South Zone <br> 5 | 24,100 | 33 | 24 | 0.10 | 2.97 | 99.90 | 2.30 |\n|  | LG1 Zone 6 | 24,779 | 15 | 14 | 0.06 | 3.10 | 99.90 | 4.50 |\n|  | LG2 Zone 7 | 262,083 | 52 | 72 | 0.03 | 3.87 | 100.00 | 2.70 |\n|  | NFW Zone <br> 21 | 255 | 2 | 4 | 1.57 | 1.50 | 98.50 | 7.30 |\n|  | NC1 Zone <br> 22 | 653 | 4 | 5 | 0.77 | 2.05 | 99.20 | 29.90 |\n|  | NHW Zone <br> 23 | 744 | 10 | 4 | 0.54 | 1.99 | 99.50 | 22.20 |\n|  | Nsplay <br> Zone 24 | 437 | 7 | 5 | 1.14 | 1.76 | 98.90 | 14.70 |\n|  | 100 | 458,071 | 10 | 190 | 0.04 | 4.09 | 100.00 | 4.80 |Table 14-3: Capping Limits by Mineralized Zone, West Model above Mineral Reserves Pit\n\n| Domain | Zone <br> Code | \\# <br> Records | Cut <br> Value <br> $\\mathbf{A u}(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{t})$ | \\# <br> Samples <br> Cut | \\% Assays <br> Capped | CV | Percentile | Metal <br> Loss <br> (\\%) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Overburden | 0 | -

Overburden was assigned a density of $1.8 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, mineralized volcanic rocks were assigned a $2.95 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ value, and the sedimentary unit to the south was assigned a density of $2.85 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n\nThe density values were averaged by volume from the sub-cell block model to the parent cell model to provide a precise change along the contacts for the sediments and overburden. Density was assigned by rock type from 590,300E to the west. To the east the density was interpolated using inverse distance weighting to the third power (ID3) interpolation method with the same interpolation search ellipses as used for gold estimation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.10 Variography\n\nContinuity analysis was completed by modelled zone using the capped 2 m and 5 m composites using Supervisor. The variograms were rotated into the plane of the modelled domains and modelled using a Normal Scores transformation. The nugget was determined from the downhole variogram, and two spherical structures were used to fit the variogram models. Variograms had a significant nugget with an average of $40 \\%$. The average variogram range from above and below reserve pit was 102-131 m.\n\nAn average well-defined anisotropy had the best continuity along an east-west strike, steeply dipping north, and gently plunging toward the west. The average anisotropy was 6:4:1 (major: semi-major: minor axis). Back transform model parameters by modelled mineralized zones are summarized in Table 14-5, Table 14-6, and Table 14-7.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.11 Block Model Parameters\n\nBelow the Mineral Reserves pit a block size of $5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 7.25 \\mathrm{~m}$ was used. Above the Mineral Reserves pit, the model used blocks of $10 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 10 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 7.25 \\mathrm{~m}$. Sub-cells were allowed; these block sizes were selected as appropriate to model the volume of the wireframes of the zones with the block model.\n\nDatamine was used to divide the parent blocks into sub-blocks defined by X/2, Y/2, and a variable block size in the $Z$ direction, to best fit the volumes into the block model.\n\nDensity was assigned and gold grades were estimated into the parent cell.\nSub-celling was used to allow the splitting of the parent cell for an optimized filling of the 3D mineralization shapes. Mineable shape optimizers for underground mining consideration were built from the sub-blocked model. The grade was estimated on the sub-blocked model, then re-blocked to the parent block size.\n\nBelow the reserves pit, to add \"dilution\" to model, the grade was regularized to $10 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ $\\times 7.25 \\mathrm{~m}$ for open pit consideration but the $5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 7.25 \\mathrm{~m}$ block size was retained. The new \"diluted\" grade was added as a separate column in the model attributes and used to report the Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit mining methods with a block size appropriated for the current selectivity of the mining operations.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.12 Grade Interpolation\n\nThe interpolation approach used to estimate the mineral resource gold grades in the block models above and below the reserve pit for the Detour Lake Mine resource were completed using an OK algorithm. An inverse distance weighting to the second power (ID2) interpolation, and nearest neighbour (NN) estimates were completed concurrent to the OK estimate for validation purposes.Table 14-5: Back

anisotropy process was implemented for the Detour Lake Mine estimate.\n\nAll mineralized zones were estimated using hard boundaries, a decision that was supported by examination of boundary analysis plots.\n\nThe mineralized domains incorporated a search ellipse controlled by a dynamic anisotropy. Dynamic anisotropy points were estimated based on the surface of the mineralized zone wireframes. Each point was assigned a dip value and dip direction (azimuth) based on the attitude of the surface at that point. The points were used to interpolate the dip and dip direction into the block model. The search ellipse in the estimate then followed the block model orientation.\n\nFor the low-grade domains below the pit and above the pit, west of 590,300E, the interpolation approach was similar. It was estimated with six passes of contracting volumes (Table 14-8). Passes six and five used a minimum of five composites and maximum of 10 composites to estimate the grade in a block. The passes four to one used a minimum of three composites and maximum of 10 composites. The maximum number of composites per drillhole was two in all cases. Estimated blocks could be re-estimated in subsequent passes.\n\nThe interpolation strategy for the model above the Mineral Reserve pit to the east of 590,300E is summarized in Table 14-9.\n\nTable 14-8Below the Mineral Reserves pit, gold for the high grade domains was estimated in six passes of contracting volumes (Table 14-10).Table 14-8: Grade Estimation Search Parameters For the Low-Grade Domains, Models Above (West of 590,300E) And Below The Mineral Reserves Pit\n\n| Pass | Major <br> Axis | Semi Major <br> Axis | Minor <br> Axis | Min Samp | Max Samp | Max Samples <br> per Drill Hole |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Pass 6 | 50 | 30 | 10 | 5 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 5 | 100 | 60 | 20 | 5 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 4 | 150 | 90 | 30 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 3 | 200 | 120 | 40 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 2 | 250 | 150 | 50 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 1 | 300 | 180 | 60 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n\nTable 14-9: Interpolation Parameters, East Model above Mineral Reserves Pit\n\n| Pass | Major <br> Axis | Semi-Major <br> Axis | Minor <br> Axis | Domain | Min <br> Samp | Max <br> Samp | Max Samples <br> per Drill Hole |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Pass 1 | 30 | 30 | 15 | MZ1 | 8 | 24 | 7 |\n| Pass 2 | 45 | 45 | 22.5 | MZ2 | 4 | 12 | 3 |\n| Pass 3 | 90 | 90 | 45 | MZ3 | 6 | 20 | 5 |\n|  |  |  |  | MZ4 | 6 | 20 | 5 |\n\nTable 14-10: Grade Estimation Search Parameters, High-Grade Domains Model Below Mineral Reserves Pit\n\n| Pass | Major <br> Axis | Semi-Major <br> Axis | Minor <br> Axis | Min Samp | Max Samp | Max Samples <br> per Drill Hole |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Pass 6 | 25 | 25 | 10 | 5 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 5 | 50 | 50 | 20 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 4 | 100 | 100 | 40 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 3 | 150 | 150 | 60 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 2 | 200 | 200 | 80 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n| Pass 1 | 250 | 250 | 100 | 3 | 10 | 2 |\n\nThe last pass used a minimum of five composites and a maximum of 10 composites to estimate a block. The earlier passes used a minimum of three composites and maximum of 10 composites. All passes limited the number of composites to a maximum of two per drill hole. In the multiple pass process, once a block was estimated, it could be re-estimated in subsequent passes.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.13 Estimation Validation\n\nThe OK gold grade was validated using:- Visual inspection: OK grade estimated was compared against the 2 m and 5 m composites along the drillhole traces in plan view and cross section. Visually, there was good agreement between the composite grades of all the estimates (above and below the Mineral Reserves pit). The modelled blocks displayed continuity of grades along strike, down dip, and plunge directions. Visual inspection of the estimates for DOM51 to DOM57 of the model below the reserve pit showed that they honoured the dynamic anisotropy points/surfaces;\n- Statistical evaluation: NN and ID2 interpolations were completed to compare estimated gold grades to the OK estimate. The mean gold grade for the NN and OK models was generally within 6\\%. Estimates for all mineral domains compared well and the estimate was considered acceptable;\n- Swath plots: Three gold grade swath plots were generated and reviewed for each mineralized zone. Oriented swath plots generally showed good agreement between composites, NN declustered mean and OK-ID2 block grades estimates. Where there were fewer data, the swath plots showed lower agreement between the 2 m and 5 m composites and the OK-ID2 gold grade estimated, which was expected;\n- Reconciliation: The models above and below the Mineral Reserves pit were validated with reconciliation with past mining results. The model below the Mineral Reserves pit was extended to the surface and reconciled with past mining done during 2022-2023. Grades reconciled well;\n- Comparison with past mining and RC drill data: a comparison was completed between the model below the Mineral Reserves pit and the $20 \\times 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ grade control model that includes RC and core drilling. The comparison showed that globally, the unified model appropriately reproduced the high-grade mineralization. Some local differences were noted.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.14 Confidence Classifications\n\n## Open Pit\n\nBlocks considered potentially amenable to open pit mining methods were pre-classified as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred using the number of drill holes used to estimate a block, the estimation pass, and the minimum distance from the nearest composite, as follows:\n\n- Measured: blocks informed by a minimum of three drillholes, with a maximum drillhole space of 20 m ;\n- Indicated: blocks were assigned a classification of Indicated if the block was informed by a minimum of three drill holes, was estimated by the two shortest passes $(100 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 60 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m})$, and informed by at least one drill hole with a composite within 50 m of the block;\n- Inferred: Blocks were classified as Inferred if the block was informed by a minimum of two drill holes, was estimated within the first four estimation passes ( 200 mx$120 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 40 \\mathrm{~m}$ ), and informed by at least one drill hole with a composite within 100 m of the block.\n\nExamples of the resulting classification are provided in Figure 14-4 and Figure 14-5.\nThese classification criteria were based on an analysis of the continuity of the mineralization at different drill hole spacings, using well-drilled zones, RC drilling, and production results (mined-out polygons).\n\nA visual check was completed to re-classify isolated blocks of one confidence classification where these were surrounded by blocks of a different confidence classification. Strings created on 40 m sections were used to create a wireframe boundary for pre-classification.\n\n# Underground \n\nMineral Resources considered potentially amenable to underground mining methods were estimated below the reserves pit and were constrained within optimized mineable shapes. The shapes were assigned based on the majority class in the block model. The classification was reviewed and manually updated on some of the shapes when the automatic classification was considered inappropriate.\n\nSome shapes fall within the area between the resource pit and the reserves pit. Where these occurred, the blocks were classified as underground but were reported with the Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit mining methods. As a result, some blocks could be reclassified from Indicated to Inferred.\n\nThe pre-classification was based on the number of drill holes used to estimate a block, the estimation pass, and a minimum drill hole spacing, as follows:\n\n- Measured: no blocks were classified as Measured;\n- Indicated: blocks were assigned a classification of Indicated if the block was informed by a minimum of three drill holes, was estimated within the shortest estimation pass ( $25 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 25 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 10 \\mathrm{~m}$ search ellipse), and informed by all the drilling within a maximum of 50 m drill spacing to the block;\n- Inferred: blocks were classified as Inferred if the block was informed by a minimum of two drill holes, was estimated within the two shortest estimation passes ( 50 m x $50 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 20 \\mathrm{~m}$ search ellipse), and informed by the drilling within a 100 m drill spacing to the block.\n\nExamples of the resulting classification were included in Figure 14-4 and Figure 14-5.\nThe criteria used to classify Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods is more restrictive than the classification used for the Mineral Resources potentially amenable to open pit mining methods because the mineralization continuity is lower when using the cut-off grade for the underground estimate.Figure 14-4: Example Confidence Classification Open Pit and Underground, Detour Lake Mine (Section 589,400E)\n![img-38.jpeg](img-38.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.Figure 14-5: Example Confidence Classification Open Pit and Underground, Detour Lake Mine\n![img-39.jpeg](img-39.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. 2024 reserve pit shell (pink), 2024 resource pit shell (blue), Indicated conceptual stopes (pink shapes) potentially amenable to underground mining methods, Inferred conceptual stopes (green) potentially amenable to underground mining methods, and historical voids (brown).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.1.15 Considerations Of Reasonable Prospects For Eventual Economic Extraction\n\n## Open Pit\n\nBoth models above the reserve pit were merged into a single model. Selecting blocks classified as Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, a pit optimization exercise was completed using the parameters listed in Table 14-11. Maptek Vulcan pit optimizer platform was used to run this process.\n\nFor the model below the Mineral Reserves pit, a pit constraining exercise was conducted based on the parameters listed in Table 14-12 using blocks classified as Measured, Indicated, and Inferred.\n\nA revenue factor of 1 was used to guide the pit design. The conceptual pit layouts are shown in Figure 14-6 in relation to the optimized Mineral Reserve pit outlines.\n\nThe conceptual pit encompassed both the Main-West and North pits within a single pit. The combined model was adjusted for mining depletions as at 31 March, 2024. The estimate is reported using a cut-off grade of $0.25 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\n## Underground\n\nA cut-off grade of $1.22 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ was calculated to identify optimal mine stope optimizer shapes assuming a transverse longhole open stoping mining method. The method was evaluated as appropriate to the sub-vertical mineralization orientation. Stope optimizer shapes were set to a maximum height of 40 m , length of 20 m , and variable thickness with an average of 14.7 m dilution included.\n\nThis cut-off grade was calculated using the parameters listed in Table 14-13.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 14.2 Zone 58N\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.1 Introduction\n\nMineral Resources for Zone 58N are covered by a stand alone model.

Grades were capped prior to compositing at Zone 58N.\n\nCapping limits for Zone 58N are presented in Table 14-14.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.6 Density\n\nAn assigned density of $2.7 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$ was used.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.7 Variography\n\nConventional variographical analysis was attempted on the 2 m composites from Zone 58N for the grouped mineralized domains but it was not possible to extract variogram models as the experimental variograms were too erratic.\n\nComposites within a $0.05 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ grade shell were selected and used to generate indicator variograms at various thresholds to identify directions of anisotropy. The range of the indicator variogram models was reduced to the drill spacing ( $25 \\times 25 \\mathrm{~m}$ ) above an indicator threshold of $1.0 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\nThe orientation of the major axis is an $85^{\\circ}$ plunge (downwards) towards $10^{\\circ}$ azimuth, highlighting the deposit vertical continuity.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.8 Block Model Parameters\n\nThe Zone 58N model was created to encompass all the known mineralization drilled, and block sizes were decided based on a typical underground mining scenario with 3 m minimum width.Table 14-14: Grade Capping, Zone 58N\n\n| Domain | No. <br> Assays | Metal Content | Capping <br> (g/t Au) | No. <br> Capped | \\% Assays <br> Capped | Metal <br> Content Capped | \\% Metal <br> Removed |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1 | 2,682 | 6,856 | 100 | 9 | 0.33 | 6,069 | 11 |\n| 2 | 639 | 1,890 | 50 | 6 | 0.93 | 1,405 | 26 |\n| 3 | 832 | 2,191 | 50 | 5 | 0.60 | 1,968 | 10 |\n| 4 | 417 | 956 | 30 | 5 | 1.20 | 703 | 26 |\n| 5 | 339 | 787 | 20 | 6 | 1.77 | 504 | 36 |\n| 6 | 146 | 311 | 20 | 3 | 2.05 | 258 | 17 |\n| 7 | 1,777 | 5,405 | 120 | 6 | 0.33 | 5,080 | 6 |\n| 8 | 510 | 661 | 20 | 6 | 1.18 | 548 | 17 |\n| 9 | 116 | 647 | 20 | 3 | 7.76 | 209 | 68 |\n| 75 | 1,785 | 3,259 | 60 | 8 | 0.17 | 2,398 | 26 |\n| Subtotal | 9,243 | 22,961 |  | 57 | 0.62 | 19,143 | 17 |\n| 0 | 83,664 | 8,369 | 50 | 10 | 0.01 | 8,038 | 4 |\n\nDue to the often narrow nature of the mineralization, a percentage block model was adopted in Geovia GEMS, and subsequently converted to a sub-blocked model for mine planning purposes.\n\nA block size of $5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 3 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m}$ was used.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.9 Grade Interpolation\n\nDue to the highly erratic distribution of gold grades at Zone 58N, a five-pass interpolation strategy was adopted:\n\n- Pass 1: NN pass within a search ellipse of $10 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\mathrm{~m}$;\n- Pass 2: inverse distance weighting to the third power (ID3) within a search ellipse of $40(\\mathrm{X}) \\times 30(\\mathrm{Y}) \\times 15 \\mathrm{~m}(\\mathrm{Z})$, with a minimum of seven composites and a maximum of 12 composites;\n- Pass 3: ID3 within a search ellipse of $60(\\mathrm{X}) \\times 50(\\mathrm{Y}) \\times 25 \\mathrm{~m}(\\mathrm{Z})$, with a minimum of four composites and a maximum of 12 composites;\n- Pass 4: ID3 within a search ellipse of $80(\\mathrm{X}) \\times 70(\\mathrm{Y}) \\times 45 \\mathrm{~m}(\\mathrm{Z})$, with a minimum of two composites and a maximum of 12 composites;\n- Pass 5: ID3 within a search ellipse of $120(\\mathrm{X}) \\times 100(\\mathrm{Y}) \\times 60 \\mathrm{~m}(\\mathrm{Z})$, with a minimum of one composite and a maximum of 12 composites.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.10 Estimation Validation\n\nValidation completed included:\n\n- Visual checks on plan and section;\n- Global statistical checks using descriptive statistics;\n- Swath plots;\n- Quantile-quantile checks on smoothing.\n\nFor the 2 m composites estimate, no significant issues were identified and the representation of gold grades in the block model from the 2 m composites was considered to be acceptable.\n\nSensitivity estimations for the top 500 m of the deposit using full-domain and 1 m composites investigated the impact of capping and high grade restraining within the mineralized domains. A multiple indicator krige (MIK) model was developed using a broad 50 ppb Au envelope as an estimate comparison. Only blocks estimated in the first three passes were considered (up to and including the Pass 3 search ellipse). The sensitivity estimations show similar contained ounces for the four principal methods of interpolation with grades varying according to the level of smoothing observed.\nThe MIK model reported more tonnage due to the lack of geological constraint at a grade similar to the full-domain composites. The 2 m composite model was used for tabulating the Mineral Resource estimate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.11 Confidence Classification\n\nMineral Resource confidence categories for the Zone 58N deposit were based on the estimation passes, which in turn were a function of drill hole spacing and minimum composites to estimate a block. The drill hole spacing at Zone 58 N is about $25 \\times 25 \\mathrm{~m}$ in the upper 500 m of the deposit. with a sparser drill hole spacing of approximately $40 \\times 40$ m deeper than 500 m .\n\nThe following parameters were used to determine the Mineral Resource classification for Zone 58N:\n\n- Measured: There are no blocks classified as Measured;\n- Indicated: blocks estimated in passes 1, 2 and 3 above elevation 5780 mRL;\n- Inferred: blocks estimated in pass 4, in addition to estimation passes 1, 2 and 3 below elevation 5780 mRL;\n- All material below elevation 5780 mRL is classified as Inferred due to the wider drill hole spacing.\n\nThe Mineral Resource classification in section view for the Zone 58N deposit is shown in Figure 14-8.Figure 14-8: Zone 58N Block Classification Composite Longitudinal Section (5,533,700 N)\n![img-42.jpeg](img-42.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Detour Gold, 2018. Figure looks north.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 14.2.12 Considerations Of Reasonable Prospects For Eventual Economic Extraction\n\nThe Zone 58N deposit assumes that it will be mined using underground mining methods, based on the use of transverse and longitudinal long-hole stopes. The stoping geometry and stope heights are based on geological interpretation with dilution assumptions considered. The mineralized domains were modelled with a minimum thickness of 4 m downhole (approximately 3 m true thickness), to ensure that minimum underground mining widths were addressed.\n\nThe estimate is reported above a cut-off grade of $2.2 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ using the parameters listed in Table 14-15.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 14.3 Mineral Resource Statement\n\nMineral Resources are reported in situ, using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards and are reported exclusive of those Mineral Resources converted to Mineral Reserves.

Mineral Reserves were reported accounting for depletion as at 31 March, 2024.\n\nMineral Reserves are reported as the diluted ore tonnage and grade scheduled to be fed to the mill over the life of the operation, based on open pit mining methods. The associated production schedule considers an optimized mill and stockpile strategy to maximize discounted cash flows. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources within the Detour Lake Mineral Reserve pits were converted to Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, respectively.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 15.2 Pit Optimization\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 15.2.1 Basis Of Optimization\n\nThe pit optimization exercise was completed using Maptek Vulcan pit optimizer.\nThe gold grade of each block was adjusted for any overburden, till, or partial backfill from prior mining activities. The gold grades were also adjusted to account for mine dilution and ore losses. The dilution process was calibrated using production reconciliation results for the past four years.\n\nThe geotechnical parameters used in the optimization respect the prescribed inter-ramp angles for the pit as established by third-party consultants, Golder Associates (see discussion in Section 16.2). The overall angles used in the optimization process account for final ramps and geotechnical catch berms requirements.\n\nGold recovery is calculated as a function of the diluted block grade and based on a recovery formula calibrated using past production results.\n\nThe parameters and respective values assumed in the pit optimization process are presented in Table 15-1. Based on the costs and price assumptions presented in the table, a set of pit shells associated with a range of revenue factors was generated for each of the deposits. The final pit selection was based on conventional best-worst case analysis of discounted cash-flows.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 15.2.2 Engineered Pit Designs\n\nThe engineered pit designs were completed using the pit optimization shells as a guide in order to maximize the value and gold recovered inside the ultimate pits. The resulting pit designs include practical geometry that is required in an operational mine, such as the haul road to access all the benches, recommended pit slopes with geotechnical berms, proper benching configuration and smoothed pit walls.Table 15-1: Pit Optimization Parameters\n\n| Item | Unit | Value |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Gold price | (US\\$/oz) | 1,400 |\n| Exchange rate | (\\$C/US\\$) | 1.30 |\n| Royalty | $\\%$ | 2 |\n| First Nations payments | $\\%$ | 0.50 |\n| Silver credits | $\\%$ | 0.21 |\n| Refining \\& marketing charge | $\\%$ | 0.28 |\n| Net gold prices | (C\\$/oz) | 1,773 |\n| Metallurgical recovery | $(\\%)$ | formulae |\n| Process cost | (C\\$/t milled) | 10.74 |\n| G\\&A cost without reclamation | (C\\$/t milled) | 2.97 |\n| Reclamation \\& closure spend (ARO) | (C\\$/t milled) | 0.36 |\n| Non-mining capital cost (sustaining + development) | (C\\$/t milled) | 4.07 |\n| Mining capital cost (sustaining + development) | (C\\$/t mined) | 0.55 |\n| Mining cost (including vertical incremental costs) | (C\\$/t mined) | 4.33 |\n| Incremental haulage cost, Detour Lake Pit | C\\$/7.25m bench | 0.0197 |\n| Break even cut-off | $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ | 0.453 |\n| Marginal cut-off | $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ | 0.270 |\n\nNote: G\\&A = general and administrative\n\nDetails of the designs are provided in Section 16 of this Report.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 15.3 Cut-Off Grade\n\nThe cut-off grade strategy adopted by Agnico Eagle maximizes the discounted cashflows. The process was completed using Maptek Evolution Strategy software.\n\nThe cut-off evaluation incorporated considerations of mill and stockpile capacities, mine constraints and economic parameters when defining mill and stockpile cut-off grades over time in a yearly basis. Table 15-2 summarizes the average annual cut-off grades for the mill feed over the LOM. A minimum cut-off grade of $0.30 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ is used. Mining will use a variable cut-off grade strategy because it moves forward ounce production and delays stripping as much as possible as it aims to maximize discounted cash flows.Table 15-2: LOM Mill Cut-off Grades by Year\n\n| Year | Mill Cut-off Grade <br> $(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{t} \\mathbf{A u})$ |\n| :--: | :--: |\n| 2024 | 0.50 |\n| 2025 | 0.42 |\n| 2026 | 0.43 |\n| 2027 | 0.40 |\n| 2028 | 0.53 |\n| 2029 | 0.48 |\n| 2030 | 0.63 |\n| 2031 | 0.61 |\n| 2032 | 0.62 |\n| 2033 | 0.55 |\n| 2034 | 0.48 |\n| 2035 | 0.42 |\n| 2036 | 0.45 |\n| 2037 | 0.40 |\n| 2038 | 0.39 |\n| 2039 | 0.38 |\n| 2040 | 0.49 |\n| 2041 | 0.36 |\n| 2042 | 0.32 |\n| 2043 | 0.32 |\n| 2044-2052 | 0.30 |\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 15.4 Dilution And Ore Loss\n\nMine dilution is accounted for by the use of mine panels that emulate variable degrees of dilution as a function of the continuity of the mineralization at different cut-off grades.\n\nThe process uses Maptek Vulcan implementation of a mine shape optimizer with different panels sizes and dimensions tested against production reconciliation results at a cut-off grade of $0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.

Excluding the muskeg, overburden/till top layer, all material must be blasted. Pioneering drilling and blasting is required in the overburden/rock contact. Additionally, during winter months, blasting of overburden material may occasionally be required due to frost.\n\nThe mine operation also requires the management of old underground workings; in general, historical records of underground workings are very reliable. Standard operational procedures regulate the mining activity in these affected areas to ensure a safe operation and risk management.\n\nGiven the smaller dimensions of the North Pit, a smaller equipment fleet size will be used.\nThe mine production schedule forecasts a total 2,088 Mt to be mined over a period of 20 years (2024-2044). A total of 818 Mt of ore is planned to be milled over a period of 30 years (2024-2053); with the last nine years of production supported by long-term stockpile reclaim.\n\nThe optimized and variable cut-off strategy combined with 248 Mt of stockpile capacity, results in an average LOM stripping ratio of 1.76 .\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.2 Geotechnical Considerations\n\nThe geotechnical design parameters for Detour Lake Pit were reviewed by Golder in 2021 (Golder, 2021a). The assessment accounts for an expanded pit that incorporates the previous pit designs of the West Detour Pit and Main Pit (Grey et al., 2021) into a single Detour Lake Pit design. The assessment also accounts for a revised bench height of 14.5 m for the Detour Lake Pit, implemented in 2020, and incorporates information from geotechnical drilling and mapping obtained as temporary and final walls are exposed. The geotechnical sectors are shown in Figure 16-1, and the pit slope assumptions are provided in Table 16-1.\n\nSector A of the northeast wall was increased to an inter-ramp angle (IRA) of $58^{\\circ}$ from the $56^{\\circ}$ IRA presented in previous pit slope parameters (Golder, 2011). This increase in IRA was implemented in 2021 and is supported by a slope stability evaluation and recommendations from Zostrich Geotechnical (Zostrich, 2021) and Golder (Golder, 2021b) based on a geotechnical drilling investigation and photogrammetric discontinuity mapping. There is opportunity to increase the IRA in Sector A-Northwest to $58^{\\circ}$ if similar geotechnical investigations for this sector are conducted.Figure 16-1: Detour Lake Pit Geotechnical Sectors\n![img-43.jpeg](img-43.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Golder, 2021.AGNICO EAGLE\n\n# Table 16-1: Detour Lake Pit Geotechnical Design Parameters \n\n| New Sector Label | Sector Azimuth ( $\\left.{ }^{\\circ}\\right)$ <br> from Bench Dip- <br> Direction | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Berm Width } \\\\ (\\mathrm{m}) \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Bench } \\\\ \\text { Height } \\\\ (\\mathrm{m}) \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { Bench Face } \\\\ \\text { Angle } \\\\ \\text { ( } \\mathrm{\\circ}) \\end{gathered}$ | Inter-Kamp <br> Angle <br> ( 0 ) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Overburden | All Sectors | 20 | 12 | 65 | 25 |\n| Weathered Zone | All Sectors | 8 | 14.5 | 70 | 47.5 |\n| Fresh Bedrock Zone |  |  |  |  |  |\n| A - North - East of 589750 E | $145-245$ | 18 | 29 | 90 | 58 |\n| A - North - West of 589750 E | $145-245$ | $\\begin{gathered} 19.5 \\\\ (18) \\end{gathered}$ | 29 | 90 | $\\begin{gathered} 56 \\\\ (58) \\end{gathered}$ |\n| B - West | $045-145$ | 18 | 29 | 90 | 58 |\n| C - South | $295-045$ | 7.8 | 14.5 | 75 | 51 |\n| D - East | $245-295$ | 7.2 | 14.5 | 70 | 49 |\n| E - North - UG | As per DXF Solid | 21.8 | 29 | 90 | 53 |\n| F - Ultramafic Talc | As per DXF Solid | 8.6 | 14.5 | 70 | 46 |\n\nWeathered Zone - Located near surface, it is recommended that at least the first bench developed in bedrock be excavated with a single bench configuration.\n\nSector A North - West of 589750 E has the potential to steepen to IRA $=58^{\\circ}$ (shown between brackets in Table 1), once the occurrence and orientation of the major structures are investigated and confirmed to not be adversely oriented.\n\nSector E - This sector provides a reduced IRA for an approximate outline of the area on the north wall in which several small drifts and an UG stope become exposed. KLG should delineate these underground openings and increase local berm catchment widths depending upon the size and frequency of drifts that are encountered. These local berm catchment increases will be at the discretion of KLG to reduce the risk of employees working near and beneath underground workings. However, proximity to and exposure of the UG stope should be evaluated more carefully, including the requirement to install cable bolts on the bench face above the stope back and upper side walls.\n\nSector F - This design must be applied for the areas where the Ultramafic 'Talc' (Talc Chlorite \\& Sunday Lake Deformation Zone) is estimated to intersect the pit walls. In addition, it should also be applied when intersecting any historic stopes encountered within the South wall. Identification of stope areas is to be complete prior to blasting benches.\n\nThe bench face angles varied from $27-90^{\\circ}$ and the inter ramp angles varied between $22-$ $56^{\\circ}$. The North pit geotechnical parameters implemented in the ultimate pit design are schematically represented in Figure 16-2.\n\nA process of ongoing geotechnical monitoring and documentation was implemented at the mine and additional risk mitigation techniques continue to be evaluated and employed as needed.Figure 16-2: North Pit Slope Recommendations\n![img-44.jpeg](img-44.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Golder, 2021. North is to top of figure.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.3 Hydrological Considerations\n\nThe mine water management plan is matched to the mine development strategy. It accounts for a pit dewatering system consisting of pump stations, pit sumps, pit perimeter wells, and old underground workings (used as additional water storage capacity to manage water inflows).\n\nWater management infrastructure includes non-contact water diversion structures and water retention ponds, appropriately sized based on hydrological/hydrogeological modelling and the changes in mining activity and stockpiling over the LOM.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.4 Open Pit Designs\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 16.4.1 Design Constraints\n\nThe design of the final pits (Detour Lake and North Pit) is guided by the respective optimized shells. The final pit design incorporates the geotechnical parameters prescribed by Golder (Golder, 2021).\n\nThe Detour Lake pit design incorporates a double ramp access for most of the LOM. The final ramp and principal access will be in the north wall.\n\nAll ramps are designed to accommodate the safe operation of 795/798 CAT super class trucks. Typical road width is 33 m with a total length of 40 m to allow for safety berm and drainage. Ramp widths are adjusted at the bottom of the pit to a one-way lane. Other design parameters include a ramp slope (10\\%), minimum curve radius ( 39 m ) and construction constraints (super elevation, crowning).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 16.4.2 Pit Phases\n\nThe phase design process accounted for the deposit geometry and spatial value/grade/quality distribution, operational conditions, haulage access/congestion over time, equipment dimensions and geotechnical considerations. The nested shells obtained during the pit optimization exercise were also used during the design process to prioritize higher-value ore and lower stripping ratio areas. Equipment operational dimensions defined the minimum widths for phase design. In general, a minimum of 150 m width was targeted during the design process.\n\nThere are a total of eight phases designed for the Detour Main pit and one for North Pit. These are shown in Figure 16-3.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 16.4.3 Pit Sizes\n\nThe final pit dimensions for the Detour Lake Pit and North Pit are provided in Table 16-2.\nA plan view of the North Pit design is displayed in Figure 16-4. A plan view of the Detour Pit and North Pit designs is displayed in Figure 16-5.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.5 Overburden And Pre-Stripping\n\nBedrock at the Detour Lake Mine is overlain by overburden composed of layers of muskeg, till, gravel, and sand. These overburden layers may be as thick as 40 m . At the start of each mining phase, this material must be stripped prior to the drilling and blasting of rock material. Depending on the material quality, weather and moisture content, this overburden material is typically 'free-digging' and does not require drilling and blasting.Figure 16-3: LOM Pit Phases\n![img-45.jpeg](img-45.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.Table 16-2: Pit Final Dimensions\n\n|  | Unit | Detour Lake Pit | North Pit |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Width | m | 1,345 | 429 |\n| Length | m | 5,500 | 636 |\n| Depth | m | 638 | 131 |\n\nFigure 16-4: North Pit Ultimate Pit Design - Plan View\n![img-46.jpeg](img-46.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.Figure 16-5: North Pit Ultimate Pit Design - Plan View\n![img-47.jpeg](img-47.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.\n\nA portion of the till material (subject to quality control specifications) is stockpiled and used for TMA construction purposes. The remaining overburden is stockpiled either in the main overburden stockpile or within designated areas of the WRSFs. A portion of this material will be rehandled for the reclamation of various waste rock stockpiles and/or TMA cells. Whenever possible, this overburden is directly placed for the progressive reclamation of ultimate WRSF slopes.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.6 Stockpile And Waste Rock Storage Facilities\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 16.6.1 Strategy\n\nBoth WRSF and stockpile strategies comply with the permitting strategy for the West Detour pit; and respect related environmental constraints.\nCurrently the mine has two WRSFs (MRS1 and MRS2), two ore stockpiles (ROMPAD and MRS2_Stockpile, a stockpile within the MRS2 WRSF footprint) and one overburden/topsoil stockpile for mine reclamation purposes (OVB1). The LOM plan includes two additional ore stockpiles (MRS4 and MRS5), three new WRSFs (MRS3, MRS2-extension and in-pit) and one new overburden/topsoil stockpile (West Detour Overburden stock).\nFigure 16-6 shows the ex-pit WRSF locations. The in-pit WRSF is shown in Figure 16-7.\nThe waste material is classified as non-acid-generating (NAG), potentially acid-generating (PAG), overburden or topsoil. All PAG waste is routed to MRS1, MRS3 or to the in-pitdump. NAG and overburden material not suitable for reclamation is routed to either the MRS2, or MRS2-extension, or is used as construction material for the tailings cells.\n\nThe stockpile strategy has the objective of maximizing discounted cash flow by the adoption of an optimized cut-off grade strategy constrained by the available stockpile capacity. MRS4 and MRS5 are long-term stockpiles that will only be reclaimed at the end of the LOM, after active mining has ceased. The ore routed to the long-term stockpiles represents material that has to be mined (within final pit limits) and that generates positive cashflow at the end of the mine operation.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 16.6.2 Design Criteria\n\nWRSFs are designed accounting for geotechnical considerations, reclamation requirements, environmental and operational constraints and the tonnage and sequence of deposition. Table 16-3 summarizes the WRSF design parameters.\n\nStockpiles are designed accounting for geotechnical considerations, environmental and operational constraints and the tonnage and sequence of deposition. Table 16-4 summarizes the stockpile design parameters.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.7 Mining Operations\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine uses conventional truck-shovel open pit mining. Excluding the muskeg, overburden/till top layer, all material must be blasted. Pioneering drilling and blasting is required in the overburden/rock contact. During winter months, blasting of overburden material may occasionally be required due to frost. The mine operation also requires the management of old underground workings.\n\nUnderground workings records are considered of good quality. The mine has been operating in historical underground working areas for the past years; the reconciliation of historical recordings and field observation of these workings is very good. The assumption that stopes were backfilled using sand/rock filled has also been confirmed. There are procedures in place to ensure safe operations in these areas. The procedures define zones classified by the risk of ground instability.\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine has used a 12 m bench-height since operations commenced. A 6 m sub-bench was used to mine the areas requiring pioneering to improve operational conditions related to boulders and pinnacles of bedrock.\n\nStarting in mid-2020 the mine transited to a 14.5 m bench height for areas to be primarily mined by rope shovels. The revised mine design has led to improvements in shovel productivities.Figure 16-6: Site and WRSF Layout\n![img-48.jpeg](img-48.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.

Operational teams work on either a seven-day in/seven-day out or a 14-day in/14-day out rotation. The mine has implemented a successful hot-seating process for its main production equipment (shovel, trucks, and drills). Management/supervisory and support personnel work at site on different schedules.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 16.7.1 Ore Mining And Stockpiles\n\nMineralized zones previously delineated by core drilling are infilled using RC drilling, which is typically performed well ahead of production to decouple this step from the mining phase. The additional information is used to generate a short-term grade control model. Ore polygons based on different grade bins and material types are generated based on the grade control model. Blast movement technology is used to incorporate and adjust ore polygons for horizontal movement during blasting. The moved polygons limits are marked in the field to guide the excavation.\n\nWhenever possible, mined ore is delivered directly to the primary crusher to minimize rehandling. When the mined ore tonnage exceeds the operating capacity of the crusher, the ore is placed on one of the ROM stockpiles for later mill feed.\n\nThe ROM stockpiles are located in close proximity to the primary crusher to allow for efficient feeding into the plant. Ore in ROM stockpiles is segregated into piles consisting of similar grade material to allow for controlled feeding as required. The ROM stockpiles provide additional buffering capacity to ensure that crusher feed is maximized while also limiting excessive tramming of loading equipment between ore and waste areas in the pit.\nAdditional stockpiling of low-grade ore exists on MRS4 and MRS5. This material is intended for reclaim after ex-pit mining has concluded.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 16.7.2 Waste Mining\n\nWaste mining is generally allocated to the rope shovel fleet. The grade control process also delineates waste into PAG or NAG material. PAG material must be routed to the MRS3 or MRS1 WRSFs.\n\nOverburden material is generally mined by the hydraulic shovels.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.8 Mine Production Plan\n\nThe vertical advancement rates assumed in the mine plan consider the spatial distribution of the mineralization, proposed development strategy, presence of underground workings and bench mining. The plan assumes a general limit of 6-8 benches per year in large development areas (waste and ore bulk mining) and 3-4 bench per year when mining areas that are primarily ore.\n\nShovel area requirements are also analyzed; ensuring the plan allows for the required space to operate the shovels efficiently. Ramp material flow limits and congestion analysis are also incorporated into designs. A maximum of a 95 Mt per ramp limit is assumed.A maximum North Pit mining rate of 5.5 Mt per year is envisaged, due to pit and equipment size.\n\nThe annual mine production plan is based on the current Mineral Reserve estimates and the forecast is presented in Table 16-5, inclusive of dilution and ore losses.\n\nThe forecast average annual gold production and tonnes mined per pit are illustrated in Figure 16-8 and Figure 16-9, respectively.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.9 Drilling And Blasting\n\nDrilling and blasting activities are performed by Agnico Eagle personnel. Dyno Nobel is the explosives supplier.\n\nDifferent objectives and geological/fractural information are considered when design the patterns and loading plans. Yields vary with the different objectives (wall control, fragmentation, higher fragmentation, reduction of overcasting material) and with areas in the pit.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 16.10 Equipment\n\nThe primary drill fleet at the Detour Lake Mine consists of electric and diesel Epiroc PV 271s, SmartROC D65s and DM45s drill rigs. Production drilling is performed primarily, but not exclusively, by PV271 drill rigs. The D65 and DM45 drills are mostly used for trim, presplit, and secondary drilling.\n\nThe primary loading fleet consists of $28 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$ CAT 6060 hydraulic shovels (operating primarily in ore) and $48 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$ CAT 7495 rope shovels (operating primarily in waste zones). The shovel size was matched with a fleet of 300-t CAT 795 AC trucks and 360-t CAT 798 trucks. This fleet combination requires 5.5 passes for a hydraulic shovel and three to four passes for a rope shovel to fill a truck. In 2024 the loading fleet will be expanded to include a $55 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$ Komatsu 4100 rope shovel to facilitate the increase in production. The primary loading fleet is supplemented by CAT 6030 excavators and CAT 992 and CAT 993 front-end wheel loaders that are used for pit clean-up, ROM stockpile rehandle, TMA material rehandle and overburden stripping.\n\nOverburden mining is primarily allocated to CAT 6060s fleet for the Detour Lake Pit. The North Pit will primarily use the CAT 6030 fleet. The CAT 6030s will be used for mining in the North Pit due to the better selectivity offered by the smaller bucket size and ability to mine in smaller benches. Phases in the Main Pit have been sized to ensure adequate space for both rope shovels and CAT 6060 shovels, until the lower ore benches are reached, which will be mined by the CAT 6060 shovels.Table 16-5: Forecast Mine Production Plan\n\n| Year | Ore Mined <br> (Mt) | Waste Mined <br> (Mt) | Strip Ratio <br> (Waste:Ore) | Ore Processed <br> (Mt) | Head Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Gold Recovery <br> (\\%) | Gold Production <br> (kOz) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| $2024^{*}$ | 33.4 | 55.2 | 1.7 | 21.5 | 0.89 | 91.9 | 563.5 |\n| 2025 | 30.1 | 107.9 | 3.6 | 28.0 | 0.87 | 92.3 | 725.0 |\n| 2026 | 31.8 | 104.2 | 3.3 | 28.0 | 0.91 | 92.2 | 754.1 |\n| 2027 | 25.6 | 108.4 | 4.2 | 28.0 | 0.77 | 91.7 | 636.7 |\n| 2028 | 37.4 | 95.5 | 2.6 | 28.0 | 0.77 | 91.4 | 634.8 |\n| 2029 | 43.2 | 91.1 | 2.1 | 28.0 | 0.89 | 91.8 | 734.3 |\n| 2030 | 53.2 | 78.5 | 1.5 | 28.0 | 1.10 | 92.8 | 919.0 |\n| 2031 | 44.6 | 81.1 | 1.8 | 28.0 | 1.08 | 92.7 | 904.6 |\n| 2032 | 46.5 | 73.8 | 1.6 | 28.0 | 1.10 | 92.7 | 914.3 |\n| 2033 | 45.3 | 71.4 | 1.6 | 28.0 | 1.06 | 92.8 | 882.2 |\n| 2034 | 41.9 | 62.9 | 1.5 | 28.0 | 1.02 | 92.6 | 853.8 |\n| 2035 | 42.7 | 63.7 | 1.5 | 28.0 | 0.93 | 92.1 | 774.5 |\n| 2036 | 38.3 | 63.0 | 1.6 | 28.0 | 0.90 | 92.0 | 744.0 |\n| 2037 | 36.8 | 61.3 | 1.7 | 28.0 | 0.84 | 92.0 | 694.6 |\n| 2038 | 36.9 | 60.4 | 1.6 | 28.0 | 0.81 | 91.7 | 667.6 |\n| 2039 | 38.9 | 47.5 | 1.2 | 28.0 | 0.82 | 91.6 | 676.0 |\n| 2040 | 31.0 | 37.7 | 1.2 | 28.0 | 0.76 | 91.4 | 628.4 |\n| 2041 | 34.1 | 29.9 | 0.9 | 28.0 | 0.82 | 91.7 | 673.5 |\n| 2042 | 25.2 | 18.8 | 0.7 | 28.0 | 0.79 | 91.8 | 656.0 |\n| 2043 | 25.9 | 14.4 | 0.6 | 28.0 | 0.90 | 92.3 | 750.5 |\n| 2044 | 14.9 | 3.2 | 0.2 | 28.0 | 0.72 | 91.6 | 596.0 |\n| 2045 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.44 | 90.0 | 353.2 |\n| 2046 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.44 | 90.0 | 353.2 |\n| 2047 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.40 | 88.0 | 318.0 || Year | Ore Mined <br> (Mt) | Waste Mined <br> (Mt) | Strip Ratio <br> (Waste:Ore) | Ore Processed <br> (Mt) | Head Grade <br> (g/t Au) | Gold Recovery <br> (\\%) | Gold Production <br> (kOz) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 2048 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.37 | 88.0 | 291.1 |\n| 2049 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.37 | 88.0 | 290.1 |\n| 2050 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.37 | 88.0 | 290.1 |\n| 2051 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.37 | 88.0 | 290.1 |\n| 2052 | - | - | - | 28.0 | 0.37 | 88.0 | 290.1 |\n| 2053 | - | - | - | 13.1 | 0.37 | 88.0 | 133.0 |\n| Total | $\\mathbf{7 5 7 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{1 , 3 2 9 . 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 . 8}$ | $\\mathbf{8 1 8 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{0 . 7 5}$ | $\\mathbf{9 1 . 5}$ | $\\mathbf{1 7 , 9 9 2}$ |\n\nNote: * Based on actual end of 31 March, 2024 mine face position and stockpile balance.Figure 16-8: Tonnes Mined per Pit\n![img-50.jpeg](img-50.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.\n\nFigure 16-9: LOM Gold Production Profile\n![img-51.jpeg](img-51.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.\n\nThe number of haul trucks required was calculated based on the rated payload of the trucks and the productivities computed from the cycle times.

The flowsheet is based upon unit operations that are well proven in industry.\n\nThe process plant was designed to process ore at an average throughput of $55,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ or $20 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$, equivalent to milling rates of 2,500 tonnes per operating hour ( $\\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{oh}$ ) with operating time of $92 \\%$ in a 24 hour day. While operating time has lagged at around $90 \\%$, the milling rate has far exceeded the design rate averaging $3,325 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ in 2023 for 25.4 Mt milled. A record throughput day of $88,370 \\mathrm{t}$ was achieved in July 2023. Table 17-1 shows the production rates from 2016-2023.\nWith the upturn of current performance of the process plant, ongoing optimization efforts and some new capital initiatives, the LOM plan assumes that the plant throughput will increase from $25.4 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2023 to $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2025 and thereafter. The annual plant throughput of $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ is planned to be achieved by increasing the milling rate to $3,474 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ and improving operating time to $92 \\%$.\nVarious initiatives have been developed to bring the plant to the $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate. Those initiatives are:\n\n- Improved fragmentation and blending based on machine learning/geochemistry;\n- Primary crusher Hi-Fines concaves and mantles;\n- Secondary and Pebble crushers variable speed drives;\n- Increasing the size of the secondary crusher motors from 1000 HP to 1200 HP;\n- Improve secondary crusher liners life above three weeks;\n- Advanced control automation on the grinding circuit;\n- Increase plant operating time to $92 \\%$.\n\nAdditional initiatives have been identified to further improve the process plant's operating flexibility, and to mitigate risks associated with tonnage increases.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 17.2 Flowsheet\n\nA simplified process flowsheet is presented in Figure 17-1.Table 17-1: Production Rates, 2016-2023\n\n| Item | Unit | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Operating time | $\\%$ | 86 | 86 | 84 | 87 | 89 | 90 | 90 | 87 |\n| Hourly production | t/oh | 2,740 | 2,844 | 2,796 | 2,880 | 2,952 | 3,054 | 3,218 | 3,325 |\n| Daily production | t/d | 56,792 | 58,514 | 56,594 | 60,370 | 62,857 | 65,987 | 69,756 | 69,685 |\n| Annual production | Mt | 20.7 | 21.4 | 20.7 | 22.0 | 23.0 | 24.1 | 25.5 | 25.4 |\n\nNote: 2023 had a 1 month transformer failure on line\\#1. \"t/oh\" = tonnes per operating hour.Figure 17-1: Process Flowsheet\n![img-52.jpeg](img-52.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2023.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 17.3 Plant Design\n\nThe process plant was designed to process ore at an average throughput of $55,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ or $20 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$, equivalent to milling rates of $2,500 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ with operating time of $92 \\%$ in a 24 -hour day. Key equipment is summarized in Table 17-2.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.3.1 Crushing And Grinding\n\n## Crushing Circuit\n\nThe primary crushing system is a single stage, open circuit, primary gyratory crusher ( 60 x 113 inches). The crusher selection was based on a feed top size of $1,200 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and a product $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of 165 mm . The primary crushing system comprises a single-stage gyratory crusher in open circuit with an apron feeder underneath. At a 125 mm closed side setting, its production rate ranges from 4,200 to $4,500 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{oh}$. Assuming an $80 \\%$ availability, the primary crusher has a capacity of $81-86 \\mathrm{kt} / \\mathrm{d}$; enough for $28 \\mathrm{Mt} /$ year. The live capacity of the feed and discharge hoppers of the gyratory crusher was designed for two truck loads each, assuming a nominal payload of 300 t . The crushed ore storage pile has a live capacity corresponding to approximately $44,000 \\mathrm{t}$ and an overall capacity (live plus dead) of $176,000 \\mathrm{t}$.\n\nOre is reclaimed from the storage pile through two reclaim tunnels, one for each grinding line. Four apron feeders, two in each reclaim tunnel, discharge the crushed ore onto a belt conveyor that feeds a new scalping screen above the secondary crushers. The undersize of the screen goes to the SAG mill feed conveyor, while the oversize feeds the secondary cone crusher operated and then discharged onto the SAG mill feed conveyor. The crushed pebbles are also discharged on the SAG mill feed conveyor as well.\n\nThe secondary crusher is equipped with a bypass chute to maintain high process plant availability. During maintenance of the secondary crusher, the bypass is put into place to feed the SAG mill directly from the stockpile. A re-feed conveyor was installed to minimize the impact on production of having the secondary crushers down. Material of $-1^{\\prime \\prime}$ is fed to the SAG mill feed conveyor with this system. This system has a capacity of 1,600 t/h.\n\n## Crusher Improvement Initiatives\n\nScalping screens have been added ahead of the secondary crushers. The first consideration for efficient secondary crushing begins with the appropriate feed preparation. Cone crushers achieve their best work when particles smaller than the desired crusher product are already removed. A more efficient head movement can be achieved as the coarse particles are easily broken into smaller particles due to the voids created in the crushing chamber. Fines, on the other hand, consume power, can induce vibrations, and reduce the crusher availability and capacity.Table 17-2: Key Design Parameters\n\n| Area | Item | Units | Note |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Crushing and grinding | Primary crusher | number | 1 |\n|  | Crusher type |  | Gyratory |\n|  | Crusher size | inches | $60 \\times 113$ |\n|  | Motor installed | kW | 1,000 |\n|  | Crusher capacity (instantaneous) | t/oh | 5,485 @ OSS = 178;

As a result, choke feed conditions are not steadily achieved, which causes uneven mantle wear and lower power utilization. These elements impact size reduction and the availability of the secondary crushers. Improvements can be made to resolve these issues such as the addition of a variable frequency drive (VFD) to the crusher's motor. This modification aims to regulate the crusher rotation speed in order to maintain power draw and choke feed conditions.\n\nThe $1,000 \\mathrm{hp}$ motors installed on the secondary crushers are smaller than the theorical 1,200 hp motor that could be installed on the Raptor XL1100. By increasing the power draw, a finer product could potentially be produced with same crushers. The impact ofsecondary crusher power draw on throughput rates is very well documented from historical data where each $\\mathrm{kWh}=1.4 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{oh}$ (Figure 17-2).\n\nThe primary crusher is a key area where initiatives are planned to generate a finer product that will translate into a higher plant throughput. The impact of fragmentation on throughput has been well documented and has a very high impact on throughput. The relationship shown in Figure 17-3 was derived from operating data.\n\nIt has been established that each 50 mm reduction in the $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ equals about a $300 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ increase in plant throughput. In 2019, the mine started a drill-and-blast optimization project that has resulted in higher throughput rates and better operational conditions. The initiative is ongoing as the mine aims to further optimize the process.\n\nThe choke feeding of the primary crusher is another key element to increase the plant throughput milling rates. It has been well established that the longer a crusher stays full, the finer the product will be (choke feeding). A unit of measure was created to measure choke feeding which is the Tons/\\#Empty events. For example, if 50,000 t was crushed and the crusher went empty 100 times, the Ton/\\#Empty event would be 500. An example for the operations is provided in Figure 17-4.\n\nThe primary crusher choke feeding still can be improved. The avenues to do this are to improve dispatching of trucks, better fragmentation to avoid bridging of the crusher, an excavator dedicated to the primary crusher re-feed, and improved rock breaker availability and performance.\n\nThe increased fineness coming from the open pit ore due to improved blasting techniques, caused some issues with the primary crusher as the fines would not flow well and cause power and hydraulic pressure spikes tripping the crusher. Using a Hi-Fines mantle/concave design for the crusher, together with High-Fines mantle liners, will raise the choke zone and fill up more the crushing chamber, which will distribute wear more evenly and generate a finer particle size, and result in reduced power draw and hydraulic pressure reduction. It is planned to install these items once the SAG mill grates are converted to 60 mm (from 70 mm ) and the SAG discharge screen to 8 mm . These modifications are needed to handle the finer product generated by the Hi-Fines mantle/concaves.\n\n# Grinding Circuit \n\nThe SAG mill operates in closed circuit with a pebble crusher while the ball mill operates in closed circuit with hydrocyclones.\n\nThe design circulating load from the cyclones to the ball mill is $250 \\%$ of the SAG mill new feed. The pebble crushing circuit with a design discharge $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of 13 mm processes the equivalent of up to $25 \\%$ of the fresh feed.Figure 17-2: Impact of Secondary Crusher Power On Plant Throughput\nGrinding Line Tonnage Increase with Secondary Crusher Power\n![img-53.jpeg](img-53.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.\n\nFigure 17-3: Primary Crusher Product Size versus Plant Throughput\nPrimary Crusher Product Size vs Plant Throughput\n![img-54.jpeg](img-54.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Kirkland Lake Gold, 2020.Figure 17-4: Throughput versus Choke Feed Events\n![img-55.jpeg](img-55.jpeg)\n\nAround 15\\% of the cyclone feed material is sent to the gravity recovery circuit. Six gravity concentrators with 48 inch bowls were selected (three per grinding line supporting a strategy of two units in operation at all time). A batch-intensive cyanidation system is used to process the gravity concentrate. The extraction performance of gold from the gravity concentrate by the intensive cyanidation system is $90 \\%$. The pregnant solution is pumped to a tank in the gold room followed by electrowinning in a dedicated cell. Modifications are planned to convert the gravity circuit feed from cyclone feed to cyclone underflow. The higher concentration of gold in the cyclone underflow should lead to a higher gravity recovery.\nThe target $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ at the cyclone overflow is $130 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, representing the historical value at which the plant has been running. It has been observed that over this value, recovery is impacted. To maintain the ore fineness of the cyclone overflow, the transfer size between the SAG and the ball-mill will have to be reduced. To do so, two modifications are planned to the circuit. First, the installation of smaller SAG discharge grates to keep more material inside the SAG mill and secondly, the reduction of the aperture of the SAG discharge screen panels from 9.5 mm to 8.0 mm . The advanced process control to be installed will also have some features that will control the final grind size.\nIn 2023, a grinding circuit survey was performed and from this the circuit was modelled using a software called JKSimmet. The simulations using this software have confirmed that at 28 Mt throughput rates and by doing such modifications to the grinding circuit, the $130 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ grind size can be maintained.\n\nOther avenues such as increasing ball-mill power draw, reducing ball-mill density and optimum ball-size will also be explored. The reduced ball-mill hardness from the West andSaddle Zone will also greatly help to maintain the $130 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{P}_{80}$ target when the plant will start processing these zones.\n\n# Advanced Process Control Improvements \n\nMany improvements have been made over the last few years in regard to in-house expert control loops. Several loops are currently used in silos and cannot provide full benefits. Future work will focus on interconnecting the silos to achieve more effective process control. Woodgrove Technologies performed an audit and provided recommendations to this end.\n\n## Pebble Crusher Variable Speed Drives\n\nBy nature, a SAG mill generates pebbles at an uneven rate. The rate is influenced by ore feed size, mill speed and the load inside the mill. As a result, the pebble crusher's power cannot be maximized given the variations in its feed. The crusher is gapped so that it can receive any surges in pebbles. The average power is therefore maintained around 450 kW while the motor is rated for 750 kW . The pebble crusher is rarely choke fed. By installing a VFD on the pebble crusher motors, the speed can be increased and decreased to maintain a set-point of 550 kW for power draw. This will enable the crusher to be choke fed and reduce the particle size discharged from the crusher. With a reduced particle size, the SAG mill throughput will increase. For each kW of pebble crusher power, the SAG milling rate increases by about $0.4 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{h}$ from the current historical data.\n\n## Ore Blending\n\nOre blending is an avenue that the process plant has used successfully to optimize milling rates. About 30\\% of the plant feed is blasted with high intensity and some of it is stockpiled so the daily blend is even at $30 \\%$. However, there are still room to do better and the new avenue that will be explored is machine learning to blend the ore. The machine learning will compare historical plant throughput performance to where the ore is coming from in the pit and make correlations with spatial location and geochemistry. It will predict the zones or area on a bench-like area near walls that will give lower throughput. These can either be blasted differently or blended with more high intensity blasted ore. Stabilizing the feed is key to minimize fluctuation in the feed going to the secondary crushers.\n\nAlso, to improve blending, new ore sizing cameras will be installed at each apron feeders feeding the secondary crushers. Each aprons feeders have different particle size due to the segregation of the ore in the stockpile. On each line, one feeder is usually coarse and the other one fine. These cameras, along with an advanced process control algorithm, will minimize the feed size perturbances to the secondary crushers which will result in improved performance and reduced fineness of the crushed product.\n\n## Increase Plant Operating Time to 92\\%\n\nThe operating time for the process plant is calculated when the ore is on the belt feeding the SAG mills. Although the plant operating time has improved since start-up, the design rate of $92 \\%$ has not yet been achieved over an annual basis, instead averaging around90\\%. This is the result of the constant plant throughput ramp-up, which constantly changes wear patterns. Once the milling rates have stabilized, it is expected that the $92 \\%$ operating time will be achieved.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.3.2 Leach And Carbon-In-Pulp\n\nThe gold recovery circuit selected was a \"leach circuit followed by a CIP\" circuit. The designed retention time for leaching is 29 hours. The leach feed size was designed at a $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of $95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThe CIP design selected uses a carousel-type system with an average design retention time of 80 minutes in this circuit.\n\nUpgrades to the CIP pumpcells have been done to support the $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate. The variable speed drive and motors for the CIP tails pumps were also upgraded to 500 hp from 350 hp .\n\nThe current adsorption profile and modelling support the planned increase in throughput rate in conjunction with the planned increased elution frequency to maintain carbon grades below $2,500 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. This will also be supported by the modifications to the gravity recovery to increase gravity recovery from $25 \\%$ to $35 \\%$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.3.3 Acid Wash, Stripping, Electrowinning, And Refining\n\nThe stripping system uses a modified version (i.e. ,on-line electrowinning and no pregnant solution tank) of the high-pressure Zadra process to recover the gold from the loaded carbon.\n\nThe circuit incorporates an acid wash stage and is designed to handle up to 10 t of carbon per day. The acid wash stage is not currently used and will be converted into a plastic removal vessel. The build up of calcium is not sufficient to warrant the use of the acid wash vessel.\n\nThe stripping circuit is designed to handle up to 10 t of carbon per stripping cycle (approximately $8-10$ hours); $100 \\%$ of the carbon is regenerated in two regeneration kilns designed to handle up to 20 t of carbon per day.\n\nThe electrowinning process is done \"in-line\" with the stripping circuit. The flow of pregnant solution is split between three rows of two electrowinning cells. One dedicated electrowinning cell handles the pregnant solution from the ILR tank.\n\nThe refining equipment is designed to handle the gold from the stripping circuit and from the gravity recovery system. The electrowinning sludge is filtered, dried, and mixed with fluxes, before being smelted using induction furnaces.\n\nThe current elution capacity is estimated to be 2.5 strips of 10 t per day. In 2021, 1.75 strips per day were completed. There is sufficient capacity to cover the increased throughput for the LOM.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.3.4 Thickening\n\nThe feed to the leach circuit is maintained at a density of $50-55 \\%$ solids by weight using one high rate thickener. The overflow of the pre-leach thickener is recycled to the process water tank. The pre-detox thickener is used to thicken the leach tails slurry to $55-60 \\%$ solids and the overflow is recycled to the process water circuit.\nThe thickener capacity is over $90 \\mathrm{kt} / \\mathrm{d}$ and can support the increase throughput without any modifications. Current flocculent consumption is low at $12 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.3.5 Tailings\n\nThe underflow of the pre-detox thickener is diluted using reclaim water prior to cyanide destruction. The tailings slurry coming out of the cyanide destruction unit and is pumped into the tailings storage area via two parallel pipelines, each with a maximum flow of $2,500 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{hr}$ each; sufficient to support the increase in throughput to $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$. Some minor upgrades to motors and VFD may be needed when going to cell \\#3 of the TMA.\n\nThe selected cyanide destruction process is the Inco $\\mathrm{SO}_{2} /$ air process. Liquid $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ is used with sodium metasulphite as a back up.\n\nA fourth detox tank was installed in 2022 to support the increase in plant throughput.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 17.4 Energy, Water, And Process Materials Requirements\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.4.1 Power\n\nEnergy consumption is not expected to significantly increase as a result of the increased throughput rate. A lot of the initiatives to increase plant throughput are related to increases in grinding efficiency with the same power. The increase in energy consumption is mostly related to the increase in run time.\n\nThe historical plant power consumption for the plant from 2018-2023 as:\n\n- 2018: 680,198 MWh for $20.7 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.033 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2019: 713,723 MWh for $22.0 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.032 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2020: 710,252 MWh for $23.0 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.031 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2021: 711,048 MWh for $24.1 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.030 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2022: 737,388 MWh for $25.5 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.029 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2023: 735,160 MWh for $25.4 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.029 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\nThe LOM assumes that the $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate will use $751,000 \\mathrm{MWh}$ per year, which the plant electrical system is adequately designed to supply.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.4.2 Water\n\nA barge reclaim water system is used to reclaim and pump water from the TMA back to the process plant to satisfy process water requirements. Depending on the water balance in the TMA, water from the open pit and various collection ditches around the WRSFs can also be directed to the plant.\n\nMake-up water for the reagent mixing is sourced from East Lake when required.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 17.4.3 Consumables\n\nSeveral reagent systems were incorporated into the plant design to provide the requirements for the different process areas, which include grinding, leaching, intensive cyanidation, CIP, stripping and refining, thickening, and cyanide destruction. Reagents are listed as follows:\n\n- Steel balls for grinding media;\n- Quicklime $(\\mathrm{CaO})$ for pH control;\n- Sodium cyanide ( NaCN ) for gold dissolution and desorption;\n- $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and sodium metabisulfite for cyanide destruction;\n- Anti-scalant for process water and strip solution;\n- Caustic for pH adjustment for the strip solution, cyanide mixing and ILR solution;\n- Copper sulphate to start cyanide destruction reaction;\n- Activated carbon for gold adsorption;\n- Lead nitrate for maximizing gold extraction and reducing cyanide consumption during leaching;\n- Oxygen (VPSA and liquid as back-up) for gold leaching;\n- Flocculant polymers for efficient settling in thickeners;\n- Ore anti-freeze conditioner; added in winter."

Visitor car and truck parking bays are provided adjacent to the guard house. The guard house is equipped with radio and telephone communication and is continuously manned.Figure 18-1: Infrastructure Layout Plan\n![img-56.jpeg](img-56.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2022.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.3 Stockpiles\n\nStockpiles are discussed in Section 16.6.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.4 Tailings Management Area\n\nTMA Cell 1 and Cell 2 are located approximately 2 km east-northeast of the Detour Lake open pit. TMA Cell 1 contains approximately 153 Mt of tailings. The facilities are discussed in Section 20.3.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.5 Mine Site Built Infrastructure\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 18.5.1 Mine Service Facilities\n\nThe mine service facilities are sufficient to support maintenance of the current mining operations fleet. It is located approximately 1.2 km south of the process plant. The largest floor space allocation is for the workshop and work-bays. The workshop is currently undergoing an expansion of four additional work-bays, two for haul trucks, and two for welding.\n\nAn appropriately-sized truck wash facility was constructed adjacent to the mine service facilities building to allow for washing and cleaning of heavy equipment prior to maintenance taking place.\n\nIn proximity to the mine service facilities and truck wash buildings are a diesel and gasoline fuel storage and re-fueling station.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 18.5.2 Process Plant\n\nThe process plant comprises three main buildings (the primary crushing building, the secondary and pebble crushing building and the main process plant building). Additional process facilities are located adjacent to these buildings.\n\nThe primary crushing building is located approximately 450 m to the northeast of the eastern Detour Lake Pit limit. Adjacent to the primary crusher, a ROM stockpile with an approximate 12 Mt capacity was established to help manage the crusher downtime. The crusher building houses the gyratory crusher and the tail end of the stockpile feed conveyor. The crushed ore stockpile has a capacity of approximately 176,000 t. Under the stockpile, two reclaim tunnels were installed for the conveyors to recover the crushed material.\n\nEach conveyor reclaims crushed ore from the stockpile to a secondary crusher located in the secondary and pebble crusher building. In this building, a conveyor collects both secondary and pebble secondary crusher undersize to convey the ore to the SAG mill. Both secondary crushers and pebble crushers are equipped with shuttle chutes and bypass chutes to enable maintenance of crushers without stopping a grinding line.There is a separate \"re-feed\" system that enables ore to bypass the primary crusher. Crushed ore is fed into a feeder that is deposited onto the conveyor belt between the dome and secondary crusher. This system allows material to be fed into the mill while the primary crusher is unavailable.\n\nThe main process plant building houses the grinding, CIP, gravity and intensive cyanidation, reagents, stripping, electrowinning, refining areas, compressors as well as tailings pumps. The leach tanks are located north of the main process building between the thickeners. The tanks are arranged in two sets of 10 tanks (four rows of five tanks) on a large containment concrete pad.\n\nThe process staff offices are located within the main process plant. This office complex also houses a conference room, lunch room, change rooms, washrooms, documentation room and a metallurgical laboratory. The plant maintenance shops are located on the first and second floors of the main process plant building on the south side of the grinding area.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 18.5.3 Administration\n\nSite administration facilities are incorporated within the mine service facilities, and include offices, warehouse, change rooms, and showers. In addition, the building also includes the emergency services area (an examination room, a treatment room, and a covered garage houses the ambulance).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 18.5.4 Explosives Plant\n\nDyno Nobel operates a bulk explosives plant approximately 3.5 km west of the process plant. The designed manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet the operation's requirements.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.6 Off-Site Built Infrastructure\n\nFacilities in Cochrane include administration offices, a bus terminal with employee parking lot and security check-ins, four houses and an eight-unit apartment block. Agnico Eagle has a shared services centre in Timmins, Sudbury, and North Bay that service the Detour Lake Mine.\n\nSGS Minerals operates a full-service analytical laboratory in Cochrane in support of the Detour Lake Mine.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.7 Camp And Accommodations\n\nWorkers are accommodated in two camps. The Little Hopper Lodge (previously referred to as the Permanent Camp) has a capacity of 611 rooms and is located 7 km west of the mining operations near Little Hopper Lake.\n\nThe Sagimeo Lodge is located just south of the mine services building and has a capacity of 824 rooms.There is also an overflow camp with 275 additional rooms available.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.8 Communications\n\nA fibre optic link provides internet access and VoIP phone connectivity to the Detour Lake Mine and connects all facilities to the Agnico Eagle offices in Cochrane and Toronto. Voice and data at site are connected via 5G LTE private network. This network has fullyredundant fibre optic backbones and microwave link backup. Satellite phones and copperlines are used as emergency backup communication methods in the event of fibre optic service disruptions.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.9 Water Management\n\nThe existing water management system was designed to minimize the amount of fresh water (non-contact water) required to operate the mine and process plant and to minimize discharge of treated contact water to the environment. Currently water management infrastructure is also designed to segregate and recycle water that has been in contact with process reagents (process water), this water is fully contained within the TMA in a closed loop and never discharged to the receiving environment.\n\nContact water from the open pit is captured in a collection of sumps and pumped through a network of piping to one of two sediment collection ponds on the surface. Water from old underground workings is dewatered using a borehole and pumped into one of the pit sumps before being transferred to the surface collection ponds. There are seven perimeter dewatering wells that are drilled and awaiting permits for pumping. Water in the sediment collection ponds is then either used to supplement water for the mill or transferred to the mine water pond.\n\nStockpile runoff is managed using a series of collection ditches and ponds. Stockpiles are encompassed by ditches that gravity feed to ponds located at topographic lows. Runoff collected in these ponds is then pumped through a network of piping to one of the sediment ponds where it is either used to supplement water for the mill or transferred to the mine water pond.\n\nThe mine water pond serves as a central water management facility (e.g., for open pit water and local runoff), and provides additional contingencies for storage and treatment, if needed. Additional details on water management and discharge considerations can be found in Section 20.4.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.10 Water Supply\n\nPotable water for the Little Hopper Lodge is obtained from Little Hopper Lake, adjacent to the lodge, and processed through a water purification plant. This is adequate for the mine's current and future needs.Potable water for the Sagimeo Lodge, mine services facilities, site administration facility, and the process plant is obtained from borehole wells close to the camp, and processed through a water purification plant.\n\nFresh water is pumped from East Lake. This water is primarily used in the process plant for reagent mixing but is also used as wash water in the truck wash facility and water makeup for the fire water tank.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 18.11 Power Supply\n\nThe existing 180 km long powerline runs from the processing facility to a tie in at Island Falls, and thence to the Pinard substation. The 230 kV transmission line currently allows for the distribution of up to 165 MW of power, suitable to service the entire Detour Lake mining operation. In the event of a power failure, there is sufficient emergency power generation for the provision of basic services."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 19.1 Market Studies\n\nNo market studies are currently relevant as the Detour Lake Mine is an operating mine producing a readily-saleable commodity in the form of doré. Doré is sent via secure transportation to a refinery for further refining.\n\nAgnico Eagle sells its gold production into the market at spot prices.\nThe estimated bullion transport costs, liability charges and refining costs used for the financial analysis are based on contract prices agreed with third parties.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 19.2 Commodity Prices\n\nCommodity prices used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are set by Agnico Eagle at the corporate level.

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 20.1 Environmental And Supporting Studies\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine area has been subject to extensive baseline, environmental monitoring, and technical studies, as per provincial and federal regulatory requirements. Studies and monitoring included:\n\n- Climate;\n- Air quality and noise;\n- Topography, physiography, and geology;\n- Geochemical characterization;\n- Hydrology and hydrogeology;\n- Surface water and groundwater quality;\n- Aquatic life (fish and benthic invertebrates);\n- Terrestrial vegetation;\n- Wildlife;\n- Archeological assessment.\n\nMonitoring of various environmental factors has continued throughout the operating period, generating an extensive environmental dataset that supports site management.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.2 Site Monitoring\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.2.1 Air Quality And Noise\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine site is remote from off-property human receptors (permanent and seasonal residences and commercial establishments); hence there are no restrictions on air and noise emissions relative to human receptors. The mine is required to comply with air quality standards, point of impingement guidelines, and ambient air quality criteria specified in Ontario Reg. 419/05. The installed operating monitoring systems assess compliance with these standards, which confirms the predictions of no significant air quality or noise impacts. Air quality and noise modelling undertaken for the Detour Lake pit (former West Detour Project), consolidated pit and underground operations predicted that the project would comply with the required provincial standards and criteria. Updates to the modelling is currently ongoing for the addition of the consolidated pit.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.2.2 Geochemistry\n\nDue to historical mining in the region, the geological materials (i.e., ore, waste rock, tailings, and overburden) relevant to Detour Lake Mine have undergone multiple metal leaching and acid rock drainage (MLARD) assessments by various investigators. Sampling, analysis, and interpretation have followed best-practice, industry-standard methods. In general, MLARD potential at Detour Lake Mine was predicted to be low. Mine waste materials (i.e., waste rock and tailings) continue to undergo regular geochemical monitoring to allow for comparison to predictions and to inform adaptive management, if required.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.2.3 Ground Water, Surface Water And Aquatic Resources\n\nDetour Lake Mine has several programs designed to be protective of environmental water quality. The monitoring network includes approximately 87 surface water stations and 152 groundwater stations. Regular data collection, analysis, and interpretation allow for risk identification and adaptive management.\n\nParameters associated with waste rock weathering have been observed in surface waters in the Karel Creek, Linden Creek, Easter Creek, Deem Creek, and East Creek watersheds. Parameter levels were not deemed to be of concern because they were either below water quality guidelines, within or similar to baseline range, and/or engineered controls have shown to be effective following implementation. There have been no significant changes to surface water quality related to current mining operations in the Sunday Lake and Lower Detour watersheds, indicating that any significant trends were localized to the mine site and do not extend beyond the site watershed boundaries.\n\nDevelopment of the Detour Lake Mine site affected some fisheries and other aquatic resources through the displacement or alteration of fish habitat. Mitigation measures are implemented to limit potential effects related to mining on aquatic resources. For the existing Detour Lake Mine, a fish compensation plan was approved by the federal and provincial regulatory agencies, following full consultation with Indigenous communities, to address impacts related to the development of the Tailings Management Area (TMA) and mine rock stockpiles. Additional mitigation measures and compensations plans are being evaluated and proposed to address potential impacts to fisheries and other aquatic resources related to continued development of Detour Lake Mine (e.g., the West Detour Project). These are in the final stages of regulatory review. Required regulatory approvals will be obtained prior to proposed development.\n\nConcentrations of groundwater quality parameters in the Karel Creek, Linden Creek, Easter Creek, East Creek, Sunday Lake, Deem Lake, and Lower Detour watersheds have generally been below environmental monitoring screening criteria where applicable. Based on sampling results to date and comparison to previous data, there have been no significant changes to the groundwater quality, except for potential seepage to groundwater in the vicinity of TMA Cell 1, which is being addressed through a detailed investigation. There are no local groundwater users in the immediate area that could potentially be affected by mining activities.The Detour Lake Mine is committed to continuous improvement through monitoring and the identification and mitigation of risks to the receiving environment.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.2.4 Vegetation And Wildlife\n\nPotential impacts to vegetation and wildlife are linked as the principal mine-related impacts to wildlife typically involve habitat alterations. Measures to minimize adverse effects to area plants and wildlife include but are not limited to: minimizing the project footprint; maintaining a minimum 120 m buffer around watercourses where possible; avoidance of unnecessary disturbance to wetlands; and avoidance of tree clearing during the bird nesting period.\nIn addition, there are a number of habitat and wildlife considerations linked to Woodland Caribou, which has been identified as a species at risk. Recommendations for the protection of Woodland Caribou include, as reasonable:\n\n- Minimizing the overall project footprint;\n- Avoidance of critical over-wintering habitat;\n- Minimizing disturbance to mature upland black spruce-jack pine forests that support a high abundance of terrestrial and arboreal lichens (a preferred food source);\n- Minimizing the potential for caribou/vehicular traffic interaction.\n\nA caribou tracking and monitoring program has also been implemented by Detour Lake Mine. In 2023, Agnico Eagle was issued a permit under the Ontario Endangered Species Act for the development of the West Detour Project. This permit outlines mitigation and compensation requirements related to further development of the mine within caribou habitat.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.2.5 Cultural And Heritage Resources\n\nArchaeological investigations were historically carried out for the mine access road associated with the previous operation, and more recently as part of baseline investigations. These studies included Indigenous participation. None of the initial baseline studies identified archaeological sites proximal to Detour Lake Mine that are likely to be affected by the mine in any foreseeable manner.\n\nAn additional study conducted in late 2023 identified an archaeological site on the south shore of East Lake, which remains outside of any planned development for the mine.\n\nThe overall potential for encountering unforeseen cultural heritage or archaeological sites that would conflict with the proposed development plan for the site is considered to be low.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.3 Tailings Management Area\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.3.1 Tailings Management Area\n\nTailings are stored at surface in an engineered TMA that is presently located east of the process plant. The TMA consists of four cells being developed in a planned, progressive manner:\n\n- Cell 1 was built over a historic tailings storage facility from a previous mining operation and deposition is fundamentally complete. Progressive reclamation of the facility has commenced;\n- Cell 2 was developed to the north of Cell 1 and is the active facility for tailings deposition;\n- The Cell 3 area is proposed to be south of the existing mine water pond, and is currently in permitting and detailed design stage;\n- Cell 4 is proposed south of the existing Cell 1 and is the current area of the mine water pond.\n\nThe TMA is designed to function as four independent cells for tailings and water management. Tailings deposition will generally occur in only one cell at any time with staged deposition to the next cell in transition years. Tailings water recycled and reclaimed for the process plant use will mainly occur from the active cell. Water from the inactive cells is transferred to active cells until final closure of each facility.\nThe initial design of the TMA was optimized during ongoing operations, as additional information became available through ongoing construction and in response to a requirement for additional capacity. In Q4 2020, tailings deposition was transitioned from Cell 1 to Cell 2. Transition from Cell 2 to Cell 3 is planned for 2029 followed by Cell 4 in 2037.\n\nStarting in 2044, tailings are to be deposited in the Detour Main Pit (mining operations in the Detour Main Pit are forecast to be complete in 2044). The TMA Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4, and former open pit will provide for storage of approximately 893 Mt of tailings solids. Capital investment is reflected in the cash flow model.\n\nThe general design and operating practices are as follows:\n\n- The tailings produced will be approximately $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ from 2024 for the remainder of the mine life. Tailings will be pre-treated for cyanide destruction at the process plant and pumped from there through a surface pipeline to the TMA;\n- Tailings will be pumped as slurry and deposited in the active cell primarily by enddumping to form smooth tailings beaches while progressively sloping the tailings surface to direct drainage towards the spillway. A total of 661 Mt will be stored in Cell 2,3 and 4 up to 2044 when in-pit tailings deposition is expected in the DetourMain Pit. A total of 232 Mt of tailings is expected to be deposited in the Detour Main Pit;\n\n- The design maximizes the tailings storage volume while minimizing the dam height, with dams being raised in stages to support use of waste rock produced during operations (and thereby reducing stockpiling requirements);\n- The dams are designed for the most severe flood and earthquake criteria, being the probable maximum flood and the maximum credible earthquake in accordance with the Canadian Dam Association Guidelines;\n- An emergency spillway that meets the probable maximum flood is maintained for each dam lift and for each tailings cell. This ensures water can be discharged in an emergency situation without overtopping and eroding the dam;\n- The TMA dams have a low permeability element(s) to provide for efficient water management and to minimize seepage rates;\n- Detailed design documents are provided to applicable regulatory authorities for review and approval in advance of each lift of the dam.\n\nThe TMA currently serves as the central water management facility for local runoff, tailings slurry water, mine water, and water reclaimed for operation of the process plant. The regulatory approval applications, submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks for amended environmental compliance approval \\#4914-CDY826 and Ministry of Mines for dam approval, provide the approved detailed design and should be referred to for design details. On an annual basis, the regulatory authorities receive operational information on water quality and receiving environment monitoring (annual environmental compliance approval report submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks), annual Operation, Maintenance, and Surveillance Manual updates, and geotechnical information on the dams (annual as-built report submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Mines).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.3.2 Cell 1\n\nDeposition of tailings in TMA Cell 1 began in 2013 and continued into Q4 2020. Ultimate dam crest elevation ranges from 320 to 322 masl and storage of 153.1 Mt. TMA Cell 1 was constructed in a series of annual raises intended to provide capacity for tailings as needed and to maintain sufficient freeboard on the dams. The final raise, Stage 8, was completed in 2019.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.3.3 Cell 2\n\nCell 2 is the second cell for tailings storage. The construction for the starter dam (Stage 1) was completed in 2020. The Stage 5 raise will be ongoing throughout 2024. The dam comprises a silty sand to sandy silt till core with graded granular chimney and blanket filters downstream of the core. The upstream and downstream shells of the Cell 2 starter dam consist of mine run rockfill with upstream and downstream slopes of $2 \\mathrm{H}: 1 \\mathrm{~V}$. The total length of the Cell 2 starter dam is 8.5 km and abuts the existing Cell 1 Dam. At full capacity, Cell2 will provide containment for 245 Mt of dry tailings and an operating pond volume of $5 \\mathrm{Mm}^{3}$, corresponding to an ultimate dam crest elevation of 324 masl. Deposition of tailings in TMA Cell 2 began in Q4 2020.\n\nSubsequent raises beyond the Cell 2 starter dam crest elevation of 290 m will be accomplished by means of a downstream raised rockfill shell with a geomembrane liner on the upstream face of the dam, with the final lift subject to ongoing optimization. Table 20-1 summarizes the proposed raise schedule.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.3.1 Cell 3\n\nCell 3 is presently in the conceptual design and permitting stage. Construction, design, and capacity estimates have been completed based on the Cell 2 for inclusion in both the mine plan and cost model. Construction of Cell 3 is scheduled to start in 2027 with a similar design and raising methodology as Cell 2. Cell 3 will provide containment for 208 Mt of dry tailings.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.3.2 Cell 4\n\nCell 4 is presently in the conceptual design stage and is being studied and sited in the TMA. Construction, design, and capacity estimates have been completed based on the Cell 2 for inclusion in both the mine plan and cost model. Cell 4 construction will commence in 2034 with similar design and raising methodology as both Cell 2 and 3. Cell 4 will provide a minimum of 208 Mt of dry tailings storage.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.3.3 Open Pit\n\nOpen pit tailings storage is presently being studied and sited based on the proposed mine plan and geotechnical constraints of in-pit tailings storage. Open pit tailings storage is expected to commence in 2044. The former open pit provides adequate storage capacity for the remaining LOM and is currently projected to store a minimum of 232 Mt of dry tailings.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.3.4 Performance Monitoring\n\nInspection and monitoring activities are performed during construction and operation of the tailings dams to assess their performance and safety; and to verify that actual conditions are consistent with the design assumptions and intentions. Inspection and monitoring also optimizes maintenance and repair costs, provides warning of potential impending risks, and provides sufficient time to implement remedial measures, if required. A dam safety review completed in 2020 confirmed that the TMA Cell 1 is performing as designed. An updated dam safety review is scheduled for Cell 1, Cell 2, and the mine water pond in 2025. Dam safety inspections are completed on an annual basis by external geotechnical consultants. In addition, various dam safety inspections are conducted on a monthly, weekly, and daily basis by operational staff at the mine.Table 20-1: Cell 2 TMA Raise Schedule\n\n| Raising Sequence <br> (Calendar Year) | Crest Elevation <br> (m) | Cumulative <br> Tailings <br> Tonnage <br> (Mt) | Operating Pond <br> Allowance <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{M m}^{3}\\right)$ | EDF Storage <br> Allowance <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{M m}^{3}\\right)$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Stage 5 raise (2024) | 305 | 132.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 6 raise (2025) | 310 | 161.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 7 raise (2026) | 314 | 190.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 8 raise (2027) | 318 | 219.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 9 raise (2028) | Varies, 320 to 324 | 245 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.4 Water Management\n\nOperational water management, risk assessment, and mitigation planning are informed by:\n\n- The integrated surface water-groundwater model, which captures hydrological and hydrogeological information to characterize and predict flows (e.g., pit draw down, water level fluctuations in the local watershed);\n- The water balance/water quality model captures water quantity and quality for both the operating and post-closure periods, under average, wet and dry conditions. The model considers sources from the TMA, open pit, and mine rock stockpiles, and other sources. This information is used to ensure sufficient water is available to operate the process plant, manage the volume of water in the TMA and mine water pond, and identify effluent discharge requirements.\n\nEnvironmental protection is ensured through the water management network, which collects seepage and runoff from all mine waste facilities through a system of ditching, pumping, and pipeline infrastructure. The modular design allows for the addition of treatment facilities if required. In 2020, a mine water pond with a capacity of $3.5 \\mathrm{Mm}^{3}$ was completed. The mine water pond serves as a central water management facility (e.g., for open pit water and local runoff), and provides additional contingencies for storage and treatment, if needed.\n\nTailings, tailings slurry water, and water reclaimed for the operation of the process plant are managed through the TMA. The water management objectives for the TMA are as follows:\n\n- Provide adequate retention time for control of total suspended solids prior to reclaiming water for process plant use;\n- Optimize reclaim water volume for process plant operations;\n- Allow for settling of suspended solids and natural degradation of ammonia in a separate mine water pond if and when effluent discharge to the environment is required;- Handle upset conditions and/or runoff generated from major storm events.\n\nWater is continuously reclaimed back to the plant site for processing needs using two barges with pumping facilities located on the tailings pond. Make-up water for the operation of the process plant is sourced from the mine water pond, mine dewatering and the East Lake when required.\n\nThe TMA is designed to contain runoff resulting from an environmental design flood. As a minimum, the environmental design flood was selected as the 1:100 year 15-day spring maximum runoff with no discharge to the environment. The TMA was designed for 'nodischarge' under this condition.\n\nThe TMA cells have sufficient freeboard to safely pass the runoff resulting from the inflow design flood through the emergency spillway. The inflow design flood is the 24 -hour probable maximum flood event. The discharge from the spillway is directed towards the watershed of East Lake which flows into the Detour River system and north to Hudson Bay.\n\nThe proactive management of water issues included incorporating prevention measures into the design of the TMA. The following strategies have been adopted to reduce the risk of contaminants entering the local groundwater or surface water regimes:\n\n- The milling includes a final process step to destroy cyanide to very low levels in the tailings before it is pumped to the TMA;\n- TMA seepage collection ditches and ponds have been constructed at the base of Cell 1 \\& Cell 2 with pumps installed to recycle the water back to the TMA.\n\nWhen required, water collected from the mine site (that has not been in contact with processed reagents) is collected in the mine water pond for discharge to the Sunday Creek to prevent the accumulation of water above target operating levels. In 2023, the discharge location was transferred from East Creek to Sunday Creek following regulatory approval.\n\nThe mine water pond will continue to operate in the current location until the Cell 4 is constructed. Following the Cell 4 construction, the mine water pond will be located to the North Pit. The mine water pond will incorporate water treatment facilities to allow discharge of excess water to Sunday Creek.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.5 Permitting Considerations\n\nMining projects in Canada may be subject to federal and/or provincial environmental assessment (EA) processes, governed Provincially or Federally. The federal environmental assessment process for Canadian mines is administered through the Impact Assessment Act, which replaced the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The federal environmental assessment process was triggered for the Detour Lake project due to:\n\n- The requirement for an Explosives Factory License under the Explosives Act for a project-dedicated explosives manufacturing factory;- The need for one or more Authorization(s) for Harmful Alteration Disruption or Destruction of Fish Habitat according to the Fisheries Act.\n\nThese licences/authorizations were granted prior to development. Agnico Eagle has engaged with the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada to confirm whether an additional federal Impact Assessment may be required for future expansions of the operating area, to date no additional development has triggered the federal Impact Assessment Act process.\n\nFive provincial EAs were approved for the Detour Lake project:\n\n- July 2010: Ontario Ministry of Environment Class EA for Electricity Projects, for the diesel power generation required to support the construction phase (AMEC, 2010a);\n- November 2010: Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources Class EA for Resource Stewardship and Facility Development Projects, for the construction of facilities offlease, and for such aspects as on-lease aggregate operations or in-water works (AMEC, 2010c);\n- December 2010: Ontario Individual EA for Electricity Projects, for construction of a 230 kV transmission line (AMEC, 2010b);\n- March 2012: Ontario Ministry of Environment Individual EA for Electricity Projects of 10 MW , for allowing a diesel-generated contingency power supply to service the construction needs should the powerline not be operable by the third quarter of 2011. With the successful energizing of the powerline in October 2011, these facilities were not installed.\n- March 2021: Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, Mine, Natural Resources, and Forestry Class C Environmental Assessment pursuant to the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act for the West Detour Project.\nIn accordance with Section 143(2) of the Mining Act, R.S.O. 1990, a Closure Plan for Detour Lake Mine was submitted to the Ontario government in 2010, followed by updated Closure Plan Amendments in 2014, 2019, and 2021. The most recent amendment, Closure Plan Amendment 3 (CPA3), which captures the proposed development related to the West Detour Project, was filed with the Ontario Ministry of Mines in November 2022. Subsequent amendments will be required to capture material changes associated with any future mine development not captured in the project description presented in CPA3 (i.e., underground production, new facilities and disturbances associated with the updated LOM plan, such as the addition of a fourth tailings cell). A subsequent closure amendment to capture these changes is currently in the development phase, with anticipated filing in early 2026.\nOther permits, such as Permits to Take Water and Environmental Compliance Approvals, have been approved, renewed, and/or amended as needed. Table 20-2 lists additional environmental approvals, or amendments to existing approvals, which may be required in order to support ongoing development and operations of Detour Lake Mine. If applicable, any additional permitting requirements subject to approval for future mine development will be obtained prior to commencement of construction.Table 20-2: List of Main Environmental Approvals Potentially Required\n\n| Permit/Approval | Agency Responsible | Description |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Provincial |  |  |\n| Permit to Take Water Ontario Water Resources Act | MECP | Taking of water of $>50,000 \\mathrm{~L} / \\mathrm{d}$ (mine dewatering and development) |\n| Environmental Compliance Amendment Environmental Protection Act | MECP | Amendment to the existing DLM approvals (air and noise; industrial sewage works) |\n| Work Permit Public Lands Act / Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act | MNRF | Work/construction on Crown land, including work below the high-water mark of local watercourses and construction of dams if needed |\n| Land Use Permit Public Lands Act | MNRF | Establish of tenure for facilities constructed on Crown land (pipeline and associated infrastructure/facilities) |\n| Forest Resource License (Cutting Permit) Crown Forest Sustainability Act | MNRF | Clearing of Crown merchantable timber (if any) |\n| Endangered Species Act Permit Endangered Species Act | MECP | Management of activities related to species-at-risk for Woodland Caribou |\n| Closure Plan Amendment Mining Act | MINES | For mine development, production, and eventual decommissioning of the West Detour project |\n| Provincial Class Environmental Assessment (Class A, B, or C) Mining Act | MNRF | For mine development |\n| Provincial Environmental Assessment Act (Waste Management Projects) | MECP | For landfill expansion to support on-site domestic waste disposal |\n| Federal |  |  |\n| Impact Assessment Impact Assessment Act | ECCC | For mine development |\n| Authorization(s) for Serious Harm to Fish Fisheries Act | DFO | For the establishment of the: mine rock stockpile(s); watercourse diversions / rerouting; and/or mine dewatering groundwater effects that would cause disruption to watercourses supporting fisheries |\n| Listing on Schedule 2 of Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations (MDMER) to authorize deposition of a deleterious substance in a water frequented by fish Fisheries Act | ECCC | For the establishment of mine rock stockpile(s) over waters frequented by fish |\n| Approval for Work in Navigable Water Navigable Waters Act | TC | For development over certain watercourses |\n\nNotes: ECCC = Environment and Climate Change Canada; MNRF = Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; MECP = Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks; MINES = Ontario Ministry of Mines; DFO = Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans; TC = Transport Canada.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.6 Social And Community Impact Considerations\n\nDetour Lake Mine continues to have a positive socio-economic impact on local communities. As of 2024, the permanent workforce totaled approximately 1,443 employees. Detour Lake Mine also creates local and provincial business opportunities.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.6.1 Consultation Principles\n\nAgnico Eagle has undertaken ongoing consultation with the public, government regulators and its Indigenous partners regarding the operations, environmental commitments, and planned activities. Agnico Eagle has established the following consultation principles:\n\n- Early notification: information about the project will be provided to stakeholders in a timely manner to facilitate the stakeholder engagement process;\n- Open communication: all pertinent information about the project will be shared with stakeholders. Stakeholder input will be sought, documented, and will be addressed in the project. If input is not addressed, a reason will be provided;\n- Accessible information: a variety of stakeholder engagement methods will be used that are written in plain language to distribute information about the project and to gather stakeholder feedback;\n- Flexible process: feedback on the stakeholder engagement process will be sought from interested individuals and stakeholders to ensure that meaningful opportunities for input are provided. Changes will be made to the public and stakeholder participation program as necessary to reflect stakeholder needs;\n- Capacity building: where acceptable and appropriate to all parties involved, community liaisons and working committees will be worked with to facilitate information exchange;\n- Mutual respect: respect will be given to the differing values and constraints of each party and to project timelines. There will be follow-through on commitments made.\nThese principles continue to guide interactions within mine permitting, operations, and exploration.\n\nFuture environmental approval applications will provide additional detail regarding the engineering design of proposed project facilities, potential effects, and proposed mitigations measures. No changes were expected to the approvals list at the Report effective date.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 20.6.2 Indigenous Communities\n\nAgnico Eagle has agreements with several First Nation and Métis communities who have treaty and Indigenous rights asserted within the operations area of Detour Lake Mine. These agreements provide a framework for strengthened collaboration in the development and operations of the mine and outlines tangible benefits for the Indigenous communities, including direct financial support, skills training and employment, opportunities for business development and contracting, and a framework for issues resolution, regulatory permittingand Agnico Eagle's future financial contributions. In addition, Agnico Eagle consults Indigenous communities in connection with permitting applications and ongoing projects.\nAs of March 2024, Detour Lake Mine has 151 employees from its partnered Indigenous communities and 115 self-identified Indigenous employees from other First Nations and Métis communities, representing 18\\% of the workforce. In comparison, the Ontario mining industry average for percentage of Indigenous employees in 2020 was $11.2 \\%$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 20.7 Closure And Reclamation Planning\n\nAgnico Eagle acknowledges that the company will be responsible for providing the full amount of the financial assurance for the closure and rehabilitation of Detour Lake Mine, subject to any required or approved changes to the Closure Plan. Closure costs were included in the economic analysis that supports the Mineral Reserves.\n\nOver the LOM, there will be developmental phases (e.g., the construction and initiation of deposition into a new tailings cell) that trigger the issuance of additional security bonding for the operation. Financial assurance is submitted to the MINES prior to the beginning of the associated activities of each phase, or as otherwise arranged with the MINES.\n\nBased on Detour Lake Mine's current phase of development, security provided to MINES to date totals approximately $\\$ 232$ million. As per the Detour Lake Mine Closure Plan Amendment 3, the total estimated closure cost for the existing Detour Lake Mine at peak development (i.e., all facilities constructed) is approximately $\\$ 256$ million, exclusive of proposed expansions such as a fourth Tailings Cell). Financial assurance associated with proposed expansions will be formalized through subsequent Closure Plan Amendments."

Capital costs are greater at the start of the plan due to development capital investments required to increase mine production to $>130 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ by 2025 through purchases of mobile equipment, enhancements to mine infrastructure (mine services facility truck shop expansion), and deferred stripping to access the next production phase of the pit. Starter dam construction for TMA Cell 3 occurs in 2027-2028. Table 21-2 provides a summary of sustaining versus development capital.\n\nCapital costs consist largely of deferred stripping using a by-phase approach, construction of tailings cells and dam raises, mining equipment (replacements, additions, component replacements, capitalized maintenance), and sustaining capital for the process plant.\n\nCapital costs for the first three years of the LOM plan are based on budget cycle estimates with supplier quotes, engineered designs, maintenance strategies, production plans or preliminary estimates. Estimates in later years are based on maintenance strategies, equipment replacement schedules, and long-term sustaining capital estimates based on recent operating history. Tailings cell costs are based on physical material movement requirements and recent unit cost history.Table 21-1: Capital Cost Summary by Area\n\n| Capital Cost Summary <br> (C\\$M) | 2024 <br> (Q2-Q4) | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 2032-2043 <br> (Avg) | 2044 | 2045-2053 <br> (Avg) | LOM |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Deferred stripping | 136 | 285 | 276 | 278 | 206 | 211 | 165 | 163 | 77 | - | - | 2,645 |\n| Tailings management | 100 | 105 | 86 | 227 | 195 | 113 | 115 | 95 | 99 | - | - | 2,224 |\n| Mining ${ }^{1}$ | 192 | 225 | 248 | 133 | 96 | 98 | 89 | 98 | 64 | 23 | 11 | 2,075 |\n| Processing | 65 | 67 | 69 | 43 | 23 | 24 | 24 | 17 | 15 | 14 | 11 | 625 |\n| Site administration ${ }^{2}$ | 36 | 26 | 28 | 40 | 32 | 9 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 273 |\n| Total Capital Costs | $\\mathbf{5 3 0}$ | $\\mathbf{7 0 7}$ | $\\mathbf{7 0 7}$ | $\\mathbf{7 2 0}$ | $\\mathbf{5 5 2}$ | $\\mathbf{4 5 4}$ | $\\mathbf{3 9 9}$ | $\\mathbf{3 7 8}$ | $\\mathbf{2 6 0}$ | $\\mathbf{4 2}$ | $\\mathbf{2 5}$ | $\\mathbf{7 , 8 4 2}$ |\n\nNotes: 1.

The estimates for deferred stripping are based on the excess tonnes of waste material mined above the LOM average strip ratio multiplied by the average unit mining cost per period, on a per pit basis.\n\nDeferred stripping is classified as sustaining capital except where:\n\n- It is expected to take at least 12 months;\n- It will provide an ore production phase expected to be $>5$ years;\n\nIn these instances, the capital is classified as development capital.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.2.3 Tailings Management Area\n\nTailings cells 2, 3, 4 costs are based on physical material movement requirements and recent unit cost history. Physical requirements include the placement of non-acid generating waste rock, till, and the production of crushed waste for dam filter elements. Additional TMA capital costs include support of construction management, quality control, geotechnical control, physical infrastructure such as power lines, pumps, and pipelines, as well as camp accommodations.\n\nMining costs related to the incremental hauling of waste for strategic placement favorable to TMA construction are transferred to TMA capital costs. Costs associated with the operation and maintenance of mining equipment for TMA construction are also transferred to TMA capital costs.\n\nConstruction of Cell 4 is planned to be completed in 2043. Starting in 2044, process plant tailings will be the proposed in-pit facility, with limited associated TMA capital costs.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.2.4 Mining\n\nMining capital includes additional and replacement equipment capital, planned component replacements of major fleets, and the capitalized portion of the maintenance and repair contract for the 795 haul truck fleet. Haul truck additions are 798 haul trucks under internal maintenance strategies with planned component replacements.\n\nMine infrastructure capital projects include the expansion of the truck shop to accommodate increased fleet count as well as autonomous drill kits, a new warehouse building for mining parts, and perimeter pumping wells for pit dewatering.\n\nMining capital costs also include costs related to ditching of mine rock stockpiles and water management required for permitting, including compensating for some of the water bodies overprinted as part of the pit expansion.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.2.5 Process Plant\n\nCapital spending in the process plant is mostly sustaining in nature related to capitalized component and equipment replacements, as well as projects to mitigate production risks including electrical distribution and corrosion.\n\nMining, processing, and exploration samples are currently shipped off-site for assaying by a contractor. The construction of an automated on-site laboratory in 2025 will internalize assaying costs as well as provide shorter turnaround time to improve operational decisionmaking.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.2.6 Site Administration\n\nSite administration costs also include site infrastructure maintenance, water management, and camps. While site infrastructure costs are mostly sustaining in nature, water management projects include development initiatives including construction of a new mine water pond, as well as a water treatment plant for the TMA.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 21.3 Operating Cost Estimates\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.3.1 Summary\n\nThe operating cost estimate is summarized in Table 21-3, and the unit costs are provided in Table 21-4.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.3.2 Basis Of Estimate\n\nOperating costs were based on actual costs seen during operations at site and were projected through the LOM, primarily using zero-based budgeting principles.\nAll operating costs were evaluated on an annual basis and included all costs related to:\n\n- Mining ore and waste;\n- Processing ore;\n- All expenses associated with site administration;\n- Adjustments for deferred stripping and changes in stockpile inventory;\n- Royalties;\n- Payments related to agreements with First Nations.\n\nThe consumables for the operation were based on a combination of current prices, contracts for future years and Agnico Eagle's view of long-term pricing, sourced from the previous life-of-mine plan, recent historical prices, and specialized third-party advisors.\n\nIn general, approximately $87 \\%$ of operating costs were based in Canadian dollars and 13\\% of those costs had US dollar exposure.

The diesel price was set at $\\$ 0.93 / \\mathrm{L}$ for the duration of the plan.\n\nMining costs related to the TMA for incremental haul of waste rock to favourable WRSF locations and operation of mining equipment were transferred from mine operating to capital costs.\n\nCamp and transportation costs for mining employees were allocated to mining operating costs based on camp occupancy.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.3.4 Process Costs\n\nThe operating cost estimate for the process plant was based on operating expenditures experienced to date. Key drivers for process costs included tonnes processed, consumption rates and prices for reagents, consumables and electricity, and plant equipment maintenance strategies.\n\nIn December 2023, Detour Lake Operation secured favourable electricity pricing as a northern Ontario industrial electricity consumer. A specialized third-party firm provided inflation-adjusted forecasts for global adjustment and hourly Ontario energy price, which were used to model electricity price at the facility. Electricity prices are projected to increase beyond inflation due to transformational changes in the Ontario grid associated with nuclear power refurbishments and decarbonization through electrification.\n\nProcess costs reflected the transition to an on-site assay laboratory in 2025.\nThe biggest contributor to the process costs was consumables/reagents, followed in order by electricity, labour, contractors, and maintenance costs.\n\nCamp and transportation costs for processing employees were allocated to process operating costs based on camp occupancy.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.3.5 Site Administration Costs\n\nSite administration costs included all materials and personnel costs associated with the mine administration and infrastructure support. These costs included camp (includingpersonnel transport), site infrastructure, First Nations, security, information technology and telecommunications, supply chain, human resources, finance, environment, health and safety, and site management.\nGeneral and administrative costs were scaled back during the mine life to reflect the declining administrative support required as mining activities decline.\nCamp and transportation costs were allocated to mining, processing, site administration, and capital projects based on occupancy by department.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 21.3.6 Adjustments\n\nAdjustments for deferred stripping reflected the capitalization of waste mining included in mining operating costs.\nAdjustment for changes in inventory reflected the build-up of ore stockpiles from the start of the plan to year 2041. Starting in year 2043, this relatively low-grade stockpile will be reclaimed to feed the process plant until the end of the plan. This adjustment reflected the transfer of costs to the stockpile as it is built and back to operating costs as the stockpile is reclaimed.\n\nRoyalties to First Nations were also reported in adjustments to operating costs.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 21.4 Comments On Capital And Operating Costs\n\nThe QP notes that while there is a history of silver in doré payments (lowering operating costs as a by-product credit), silver is not estimated in the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves, and therefore not included in cost estimates. Payments for silver in doré represent a minor upside to the Project.\n\nThe QP notes that as the model assumes Detour Lake Mine is a stand-alone tax entity, corporate tax synergies with other mining operations are not included in the economic analysis. This includes the treatment of carbon tax credits included in mine operating costs."

The forecast recoveries for the 2024 PEA are provided in Section 13.5.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.12 Mineral Resource Estimates\n\nThe drill hole database supporting the Mineral Resource estimates for the 2024 PEA estimate had a cut-off date of October 16, 2023. The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of March 31, 2024, which is the last date for depleting material mined from the open pit.\n\nThe Mineral Resource for the 2024 PEA was estimated using OK, based on drill hole data constrained by interpreted domains. The geological model, estimation domains, and Mineral Resource estimates were completed using Datamine Studio RM ver. 1.13.202.0. Supervisor V. 8.15.1 was used to carry out the geostatistical analysis, variography and topcut studies.\n\nThe Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining were defined below the reserve pit design, and within optimized mineable shapes. The classification of this material is for the entire mineable shape optimizer, based on a pre-classification assigned to the block model cells. Optimized mineable shapes were assigned with the majority class in the block model. The classification was reviewed and manually updated on some of the optimized mineable shapes when the automatic classification was considered inappropriate.Mineral Resources considered to be \"high-grade\" are reported at a cut-off grade of $1.22 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\nMineral Resources were classified as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred based on the number of drill holes used to estimate a block, the estimation pass, and the minimum distance from an average composite distance. No blocks were classified as Measured. Blocks were assigned a classification of Indicated if the block was informed by a minimum of three drill holes, was estimated within the shortest estimation pass, and informed by the drilling within a 50-m drill spacing to the block. Blocks were classified as Inferred if the block was informed by a minimum of two drill holes, was estimated within the two shortest estimation passes, and informed by the drilling within a $100-\\mathrm{m}$ drill spacing to the block.\n\nA visual check was completed to re-classify blocks from Inferred to Indicated if the Inferred blocks were isolated within the bulk of the indicated blocks. Strings created on $40-\\mathrm{m}$ sections were used to create a wireframe boundary for re-classification. All remaining estimated blocks were not classified.\n\nMineral Resources were reported within mineable shapes developed with the mineable shape optimizer software. A location plan showing the Mineral Resources within the potentially mineable shapes is included as Figure 24-1.\n\nFor the 2024 PEA, mineable stope shapes were generated using an assumed gold price of $\\$ 1,400$ per ounce and a CAD:USD exchange rate of 1.30. Approximately 4.6 million ounces of contained gold or $55 \\%$ of the Mineral Resources that are insitu, and assumed to be mined using underground mining methods, are incorporated in the 2024 PEA. Within the underground mine plan, approximately $15 \\%$ of the gold ounces are categorized as Indicated Mineral Resources and 85\\% are categorized as inferred Mineral Resources. A breakdown of the March 31, 2024 estimate and the Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining included in the 2024 PEA is set out in Table 24-1.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.13 Mineral Reserve Estimates\n\nThis section is not relevant to the 2024 PEA, as the 2024 PEA mine plan is based on Mineral Resources only.Figure 24-1: Long Section Showing Potentially Mineable Shapes, 2024 PEA\n![img-57.jpeg](img-57.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. 2024 Mineral Reserve pit shell (pink), 2024 Mineral Resource pit shell (blue), Indicated conceptual stopes (pink shapes) potentially amenable to underground mining methods, Inferred conceptual stopes (green) potentially amenable to underground mining methods, and historical voids (brown).Table 24-1: Summary of the Mineral Resource Potentially Amenable to Underground Mining Methods\n\n| Confidence Classification | As at March 31, 2024 |  |  | Subset of Mineral Resource Estimate Included In 2024 PEA Mine Plan |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained Metal (Moz Au) | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained Metal (Moz Au) |\n| Indicated Mineral Resources |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Inside March 2024 Resource Pit | 9.0 | 1.83 | 0.5 | 4.5 | 2.34 | 0.3 |\n| Outside March 2024 Resource Pit | 10.0 | 2.02 | 0.7 | 4.5 | 2.37 | 0.3 |\n| Total Indicated | 19.0 | 1.94 | 1.2 | 9.0 | 2.36 | 0.7 |\n| Inferred Mineral Resources |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Inside March 2024 Resource Pit | 50.8 | 2.06 | 3.4 | 24.3 | 2.46 | 1.9 |\n| Outside March 2024 Resource Pit | 56.8 | 2.04 | 3.7 | 24.2 | 2.53 | 2.0 |\n| Total Inferred | 107.7 | 2.05 | 7.1 | 48.5 | 2.50 | 3.9 |\n\nNote:\n\n1.

Inputs into the shapes include a US\\$1,400/oz Au price, and optimal stope shapes of 40 m in height.\n4. The subset of the Mineral Resources within the 2024 PEA mine plan are reported using a cut-off of $1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.14 Mining Methods\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.1 Introduction\n\nThe mining method selected for the 2024 PEA is transverse longhole open stoping (LHOS), as it is best suited to the underground mineral deposit, which is sub-vertical with a steep dip in generally competent rock.\n\nStoping is planned between Level 120 and Level 880. Levels are named according to their distance in metres below surface. The level spacing will be 40 m and the stope panel length will be 20 m . Mining will be transverse with a minimum stope width of 8.0 m , with a plannedequivalent linear overbreak slough dilution of 1.5 m on the hanging wall and 1.0 m on the footwall.\n\nThe mining sequence will advance multiple pyramids in a bottom-up chevron sequence using primary and secondary stopes. Primaries will all be backfilled with cemented paste fill. Secondary backfill will be either cemented paste fill or waste rock fill according to the sequence and waste material available.\n\nThe 2024 PEA mine plan assumes a five-year development period (2025-2029), a threeyear operational ramp-up (2030-2032), and 12 years of production with an average mill feed of $11,200 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$.\n\nThe underground development material grading $0.3-1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ could be directed to the lowgrade stockpile currently used for the Detour Lake open pit. This option would increase the gold production over the LOM and limit the amount of waste rock tonnage sent to the WRSF.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.2 Geotechnical Considerations\n\n## Design Approach and Acceptance Criteria\n\nThe main stratigraphic units that would be intercepted by 2024 PEA mine plan include pillow flows, mafic flows, chloritic greenstone, various intrusive rocks (felsic intrusive, intermediate intrusive, mafic intrusive) and talc chlorite.\n\nA series of sub-vertical faults have been identified from a combination of drilling, geophysical surveys, and surface lineations.\n\nThe design approach is based on the application of the domain input parameters listed in Table 24-2, to design assessments. The performance criteria and design assessments were selected to reflect the anticipated rock mass behaviours of the chloritic greenstone and flow domains.\n\nTwo domains were considered for the design assessments, the intrusive-porphyry-flow (flow) and the chloritic greenstone domains. Intact strength and rock mass characterization indicate that the intrusive, porphyry and flow lithologies (PF, MF, FI, MI, Intermediate Intrusion and IFP) are similar and likely to have similar rock mass behaviour. While there is variability in the unconfined compressive strengths of the intrusive lithologies, the properties of the mafic and pillow flow lithologies were assumed for the flow domain. For this domain, the lower limit mafic flow rock mass rating (RMR ${ }_{76}$ ) and the pillow flow thirtyfifth percentile $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{35}\\right)$ unconfined compressive strength values were assumed for the design assessments. Due to their limited width and localized nature, the variability of the intrusive lithologies was not considered for the 2024 PEA design assessments. However, this may need to be considered for local stability and ground support design in future study phases.Table 24-2: Domain Design Assessment Input Parameters\n\n| Domain | Lower Bound <br> $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\prime} / \\mathbf{R M R}_{\\mathbf{7 6}}$ | Base Case <br> $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\prime} / \\mathbf{R M R}_{\\mathbf{7 6}}$ | Upper Bound <br> $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\prime} / \\mathbf{R M R}_{\\mathbf{7 6}}$ | Design $\\sigma_{\\mathbf{0 1}}$ <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathbf{3 5}}\\right)$ |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Chloritic greenstone | $9 / 72$ | $14 / 77$ | $21 / 82$ | 73 |\n| Intrusive, porphyry, flow | $13 / 75$ | $20 / 80$ | $30 / 85$ | 185 |\n\nNote: RMR = rock mass rating, $\\mathrm{Q}^{\\prime}=$ rock mass quality.\n\nThe chloritic greenstone domain has a lower intact rock strength, and a slightly lower rock mass quality relative to the flow domain. Owing to the chloritic greenstone strength testing data limitations, lower confidence is assigned to the intact rock strength. Subsequent study levels should include additional and more complex (i.e., post-peak) laboratory testing to anticipate rock mass behaviour and the predominant failure mode for the chloritic greenstone domain. Given its lower design strength, uncertainty exists as to how the chloritic greenstone will respond at moderate depth under increasing induced stresses (e.g., accumulating stress-induced damage such as spalling and bulking or unravelling). At lower induced stresses, rock mass behaviour is anticipated to be structurally controlled. At moderate to higher induced stresses, rock mass failure is expected to involve a combination of shear/tensional failure and structure.\n\nThe flow domain is characterized by a very to extremely strong intact rock strength, and a good quality rock mass. Confidence in the rock mass classification and design strength for this domain is high. For the planned mining depths ( 800 m ), overall/post-peak rock mass failure is not anticipated. The predominant failure modes are anticipated to be structurally controlled, influenced by relaxation (confinement loss) and a combination of structurallycontrolled and stress-induced damage accumulation (stress-induced spalling and fracturing at depth, for higher extraction ratios and certain pillar geometries).\nThe design assessments presented in the following sections employ a variety of empirical, kinematic, and numerical modelling approaches to the chloritic greenstone and flow domains. As overall failure (yield or post-peak) is not anticipated, elastic modelling is considered appropriate for the 2024 PEA.\n\n# Stope Design \n\nA level spacing of 40 m (floor-to-floor) and panel lengths along strike of 20 m are assumed for the definition of stope shapes. The hanging wall-footwall minimum mining thickness is 8 m .\n\nWSP (2024b), considered stope dimensions for the flow and chloritic greenstone domains at depths of $150 \\mathrm{~m}, 450 \\mathrm{~m}$, and 750 m , for stope dips varying from $50^{\\circ}$ to $90^{\\circ}$. Base case Q' values were assumed for the domains. The stability graph acceptability criteria considered the mid-point of the unsupported Transition Zone (Potvin, 1988) to assess the limit of stable stope geometries without the addition of secondary support (cables). Thelimit of supportability, based on cases where cable support was added, was defined based on Hadjigeorgiou et al. (1995). These limits are shown in Figure 24-2.\n\nFor these analyses, a geology deposit parallel foliation is assumed to be within $0-30^{\\circ}$ of stope hanging wall and footwall. While the minimum dip of the stope shape is $50^{\\circ}$, it is assumed that the drilled-off geometries will be steepened to $55^{\\circ}$ or greater to ensure the flow of blasted material. The stability graph assessment is summarized in Table 24-3.\n\nStope overbreak was estimated using the equivalent linear overbreak slough curves developed by Clark (1998). WSP (2024b) suggests that most stope geometries, regardless of domain, will experience hanging wall equivalent linear overbreak slough of $0.5-1 \\mathrm{~m}$ and $0.5-2.0$ in the stope backs. If lower bound rock mass classification (Q') parameters are considered for the chloritic greenstone and flow domains, predicted equivalent linear overbreak slough values increase.\n\nIn addition to the stability graph assessment, simple three-dimensional (3D) elastic modelling was carried out to estimate the zone of confinement loss (tensile conditions) around typical stope geometries. Table 24-4 summarizes the WSP (2024b) equivalent linear overbreak slough guidance. This guidance combined the results of stability graph and numerical modelling assessments. The Agnico Eagle equivalent linear overbreak slough guidance (i.e., 1.5 m of hanging wall dilution and 1.0 m of footwall dilution) was used to generate mineable stope optimizer shapes for the 2024 PEA and reflects Agnico Eagle's view on the uncertainty surrounding in-situ stresses and the strength and rock mass behaviour of the chloritic greenstone domain.\n\nThe Agnico Eagle guidance is considered appropriate for the flow domain and somewhat aggressive for the chloritic greenstone domain, and increases the reliance on the cable support to control dilution.\n\nAll stope backs will be cabled. Drawpoints will be cabled to provide brow support. WSP (2024b) assumes a hanging wall cable spacing of $1.5-2.0 \\mathrm{~m}$ (base case) to $1.0-1.5 \\mathrm{~m}$ (lower bound) consisting of four cables per ring spaced at 2 m (2-6 m cables and 2-9 m cables per ring) fanned into the hanging wall. Installation of hanging wall support will depend on whether stopes are accessed from the footwall (fanned from the end of the draw point) or the hanging wall (fanned into floor towards the hanging wall).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.3 Hydrogeological Considerations\n\nHydrogeology estimation models were prepared by GeoProcess (2023), and the results and key outcomes of this study are summarized below:\n\n- The modelling of groundwater inflows to the planned underground workings produced a baseline estimate of $4,154 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} /$ day, with variability in the different model parameters producing alternative estimates than generally ranged from 3,680$4,904 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} /$ day;Figure 24-2: Stability Graph showing Design Curves Mid-Point of Unsupported Zone and Support Limit\n![img-58.jpeg](img-58.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024, after Potvin (1988) and Hadjigeorgiou et al., 1995.Table 24-3: Stability Graph Assessment by Domain and Depth\n\n| Domain | Depth (m) | Location | A <br> Factor | B- <br> Factor | C- <br> Factor | $\\mathrm{Q}^{\\prime}$ <br> Base <br> Case | $\\mathrm{N}^{\\prime}$ | ELOS (m) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Chloritic greenstone | 150 | Back | 0.25 | 0.2 | 2 | 14 | 1.4 | $1-2$ |\n|  |  | HW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $4.1-8.0$ | 14 | $11.48-33.6$ | $0.5-1$ |\n|  |  | FW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $3.5-8.0$ | 14 | $9.8-33.6$ |  |\n|  |  | End | 0.30 | 0.3 | 3 | 14 | 3.78 |  |\n|  | 450 | Back | 0.15 | 0.2 | 2 | 14 | 0.84 | $>2$ |\n|  |  | HW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $4.1-8.0$ | 14 | $11.48-33.6$ | $0.5-1$ |\n|  |  | FW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $3.5-8.0$ | 14 | $9.8-33.6$ |  |\n|  |  | End | 0.15 | 0.3 | 3 | 14 | 1.89 |  |\n|  | 750 | Back | 0.10 | 0.2 | 2 | 14 | 0.56 | $>2$ |\n|  |  | HW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $4.1-8.0$ | 14 | $11.48-33.6$ | $0.5-1$ |\n|  |  | FW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $3.5-8.0$ | 14 | $9.8-33.6$ |  |\n|  |  | End | 0.10 | 0.3 | 3 | 14 | 1.26 |  |\n| Flow | 150 | Back | 0.85 | 0.2 | 2 | 20 | 6.8 | $0.5-1$ |\n|  |  | HW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $4.1-8.0$ | 20 | $16.4-48$ | $<0.5$ |\n|  |  | FW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $3.5-8.0$ | 20 | $14-48$ |  |\n|  |  | End | 1.00 | 0.3 | 3 | 20 | 18 |  |\n|  | 450 | Back | 0.30 | 0.2 | 2 | 20 | 2.4 | $1-2$ |\n|  |  | HW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $4.1-8.0$ | 20 | $16.4-48$ | $0.5-1$ |\n|  |  | FW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $3.5-8.0$ | 20 | $14-48$ |  |\n|  |  | End | 0.35 | 0.3 | 3 | 20 | 6.3 |  |\n|  | 750 | Back | 0.25 | 0.2 | 2 | 20 | 2 | $1-2$ |\n|  |  | HW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $4.1-8.0$ | 20 | $16.4-48$ | $0.5-1$ |\n|  |  | FW | 1.00 | $0.2-0.3$ | $3.5-8.0$ | 20 | $14-48$ |  |\n|  |  | End | 0.25 | 0.3 | 3 | 20 | 4.5 |  |\n\nNote: $\\mathrm{HW}=$ hanging wall. $\\mathrm{FW}=$ footwall.Table 24-4: Equivalent Linear Overbreak Slough Guidance\n\n| Domain | Location: Depth <br> (m) | ELOS Guidance <br> WSP (2024b) <br> (m) | ELOS Guidance <br> AEM <br> (m) |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Chloritic greenstone | Back: 0-300 | $<1.5$ |  |\n|  | HW: 0-350 | $<1$ | 1.5 |\n|  | FW: 0-350 |  | 1.0 |\n|  | Back: 300-800 | $<2$ |  |\n|  | HW: 350-800 | $<2.5$ | 1.5 |\n|  | FW: 350-800 |  | 1.0 |\n| Flow | Back: 0-300 | 1 |  |\n|  | HW: 0-350 | $<1$ | 1.5 |\n|  | FW: 0-350 |  | 1.0 |\n|  | Back: 300-800 | $<2$ |  |\n|  | HW: 350-800 | $<2$ | 1.5 |\n|  | FW: 350-800 |  | 1.0 |\n\nNote: ELOS = equivalent linear overbreak slough.

At all lakes, the model results predict decreases in average lake outflows ranging from $0.1-7.2 \\%$, with larger impacts typically associated with headwater lakes located nearer to the underground footprint;\n- The numerical groundwater model was used to evaluate the incremental change in groundwater discharge to natural stream channels as a result of the proposed dewatering of the underground workings. Modelled baseflow values decreased by $<5 \\%$ along the mapped (modelled) natural water courses, except for a small headwater tributary to Deem Lake and a section of Linden Creek between North Linden and South Linden ponds which had modelled baseflow decreases of between $5-10 \\%$.\n\nSump excavations will be placed at the low points on each level, and at specific locations along the ramp, to allow the used water to drain in an orderly manner. These sumps will then be connected to form a dewatering network, eventually flowing to the pumping system, to be pumped out of the underground mine, or to be recirculated in the water supply network and used again.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.4 Subset Of The Mineral Resource Estimate Used In The 2024 Pea Mine Plan\n\nThe subset of the Mineral Resource estimate used in the 2024 PEA mine plan was determined using the following procedures:\n\n- Review of geological information and resource block model;\n- Determination of a reasonable cut-off value from potential operating costs and revenue forecasts;\n- Determination of reasonable minimum and maximum mining unit dimensions and other key parameters (i.e., minimum dip angle, minimum pillar between stacked stope, overbreak);\n- Determination of the dilution and mining recovery;\n- Determination of potential mineable stopes using the mineable stope optimizer;\n- Refinement of mineable stopes (i.e., removal of shapes within the crown pillar, removal of shapes isolated from more substantial mining areas);\n- Generation of mine design and mine plan;\n- Validation of assumptions and parameters.\n\nThe subset of the Mineral Resources used in the 2024 PEA mine plan were constrained within mineable stope optimizer shapes that used the input parameters summarized in Table 24-5 to determine the cut-off grade to be used for stope designs. The resulting subset of the Mineral Resource estimate used in the 2024 PEA mine plan is provided in Table 24-6. Figure 24-3 shows the locations of the proposed stopes.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.5 Access And Development\n\nAccess to all underground workings will be via a main decline and conveyor ramp for material. The mineralized material will be transferred to the conveyor with trucks and material chutes. The main decline ramp development is planned to start in January 2025, and the conveyor ramp in January 2027. The section profile of both ramps will be 5.5 m high by 5.5 m wide.\n\nUnderground infrastructure must be developed in advance of providing mill feed. The access ramp linking the surface to the different underground mining regions, the conveyor including its crosscuts and associated infrastructure, the accesses for the main fresh air and exhaust raises, the material chutes and the backfill system are on the critical path. More than 19 km of lateral development is required (Year -5 to Year 1) in order to obtain the first stope tonnes and commence production in Q2 2030.\n\nDevelopment advance rates are based on performances obtained in different analogous mines in the Abitibi region and on mining first principles calculations.Table 24-5: Parameters used in Cut-off Grade Calculations\n\n| Parameter | Unit | Value |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Gold price | $\\$ \\mathrm{US} / \\mathrm{oz}$. | $1,400.00$ |\n| Exchange rate | $\\$ \\mathrm{C} / \\$ \\mathrm{US}$ | 1.30 |\n| Total operating cost | $\\$ \\mathrm{C} /$ tonne | 74.04 |\n| Royalties and First Nations payments | $\\%$ | 2.80 |\n| Smelting charge | $\\$ \\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{oz}$ | 5.82 |\n| Gold payable in doré | $\\%$ | 100.00 |\n| Gold recovery in doré | $\\%$ | 100 |\n| Processing plant recovery | $\\%$ | 95.00 |\n| Mining recovery | $\\%$ | 92 |\n| Cut-off grade | $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ | 1.8 |\n| Incremental cut-off grade | $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ | 1.5 |\n\nTable 24-6: Subset of Mineral Resource Estimate Used In 2024 PEA Mine Plan\n\n| Confidence Category | Tonnage <br> $(\\mathbf{k t})$ | Grade <br> $(\\mathbf{g} / \\mathbf{t} \\mathbf{A u})$ | Contained Metal <br> $(\\mathbf{k o z} \\mathbf{A u})$ |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Indicated | 8,178 | 2.33 | 611 |\n| Inferred | 44,667 | 2.48 | 3,568 |Figure 24-3: Longitudinal View Showing 2024 PEA Stopes\n![img-59.jpeg](img-59.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024. 2024 Reserve Pit Shell (pink), mine development (black), and historical voids (grey).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.6 Drill And Blast\n\nLongitudinal stopes will be drilled using $140-\\mathrm{mm}$ (5.5\") holes with a $762-\\mathrm{mm}$ (30\") slot. Typical drilling pattern parameters envisaged (i.e., burden and spacing) are summarized in Table 24-7. The average drilling factor will be $12.2 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{m}$ drilled and the average powder factor will be $0.94 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{t}$. These factors were derived from drill and blast plans developed for the average transverse stope layout configuration (Figure 24-4).\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.7 Mucking, Hauling And Material Handling\n\nThe underground mine will be divided into six mining regions, and mineralization will be directed to the crusher once it is operational. The stope mucking will be completed using automated load-haul-dump (LHD) vehicles. The tramming distance will be limited to a maximum of 250 m . The scoop will either dump material down a material chute or load the trucks directly in the footwall drift. Regardless of the region or the loading point, all scenarios use 21 t automated LHDs for mucking. Smaller 17 or 18 t LHDs will be used for rock fill. All the trucks will be 60 t , with operators (no automation).\n\nBetween loading trucks, LHDs will stockpile material in the nearest re-muck, to minimize truck wait times. The automated LHDs will also provide continuous mucking during lunch breaks and between shifts, to reduce truck wait times.\n\nTrucks will either be loaded from an LHD in the footwall drive next to a stope or from a material chute.\n\nThe material chute network will consist of eight Alimak raises strategically located to minimize truck haulage distances between the mining regions and the crusher. Drop raise fingers will be blasted to connect some levels with the material chute raise system. At each material chute dumping point, a cone plug will be built over the finger to control the ventilation.\n\nMaterial will be hauled to the main underground crushing system, and crushed prior to being conveyed to the surface. The crushing system will be located at a low point in the mine to allow material chutes to be built at different locations and thus to minimize truck haulage.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.8 Ventilation\n\nThe ventilation system design is a push system capable of delivering more than $566.3 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}$ ( $1,200 \\mathrm{kcfm}$ ) of fresh air from surface to the underground workings. The ventilation airflow requirements followed Ontario Regulation 854: Mines and Mining Plants, Section 183.1. According to the regulation, the airflow requirement for a certified engine must be at least equal to the ventilation rate of the certificate of homologation; and should the engine not be certified, a rate of $0.06 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{sec}$ for each kilowatt of power must be applied. Following the underground mining ventilation good practices, the ventilation airflow requirements are based on a Canmet-certified engine for an equipment with the proper specification according to the mine fleet and the use of a utilization rate.Table 24-7: 2024 PEA Drill and Blast Pattern\n\n| Drilling Pattern | $(\\varnothing \\pm 140 \\mathrm{~mm})$ |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Burden | 3.2 m |\n| Spacing | 3.6 m |\n\nFigure 24-4: Transverse Drilling Pattern Section for an Average Stope\n![img-60.jpeg](img-60.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.The final ventilation system will use a single main fresh air raise (FAR), 7.5 m in diameter, to provide ventilation to the different mining zones with two main surface fans. The fresh air from the FAR will be fed to the regions through a series of ventilation access drifts and raises supplying air to the main ramp or to the levels, depending on the location. The main ramp and the conveyor ramp will act as exhaust points alongside two main return air raises (RAR). The evolution of the ventilation network will follow the mining phases.\n\nPhase 1 (Figure 24-5) corresponds to the ventilation for the development of the infrastructure and the production ramp-up. Figure 24-6 corresponds to the ventilation for Phase 2, the steady-state production and the mining of the Upper West, Lower Saddle, Upper Saddle and Old Workings areas (see discussion in Section 24.14.10). The sizing of the main fans accommodates the steady state production rate of $11,200 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ ore, with all of the lateral extensions. As Phase 2 ends and Phase 3 begins, the main fans must allow mining of the incremental $1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ cut-off grade tonnes and allow for the development of the West Extension (Figure 24-7).\n\nAll main fans will be set to operate in parallel. Alongside the main fans, a $112 \\mathrm{MBTU} / \\mathrm{h}$ heater will be used to provide heating in the colder months of up to $2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.9 Backfill\n\nOnce empty, stopes will be backfilled with cemented paste backfill or rockfill. The paste backfill plant will be located on surface near the portal area. Backfill material is assumed to be composed of unclassified tailings piped from the processing plant, cement and water and is distributed via a piping pumping system through the underground paste line network.\n\nThe optimal cemented paste backfill characteristics (i.e., the recipe and the binder type for the Project) were determined based on Document 33200-284-235-TCR-001 (P\\&C, 2021) that includes Detour tailings characterization, standard paste backfill tests and cemented aggregate fill backfill tests. The cement binder content was assumed to be $2.5 \\%$ binder with $76.5 \\%$ overall solids tailings content, and was expected to reach a resistance of $>500$ kPa after 28 days of curing.\n\nThe paste pumping system was designed for a $12,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ capacity, to be provided by two individual $6,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ twin lines, and to operate at a steady pressure of 100 bars through a NPS 8 pipe size line.\n\nThe paste plant arrangement on surface (Figure 24-8), will consist of the paste plant with a pump and three drill holes to connect to different sectors of the underground network to cover all the stopes to be mined in all areas. The plant location was selected considering the available space on surface restricted by the open pits, and the potential for mineralization expansion to the west, which implies a potential increase in stopes to be backfilled on the west side. The planned three drill holes from surface will reach the underground at different elevations. The location of the drill holes could be adjusted in relation to the ventilation network to minimize any additional development.\n\nAdditional information on the paste backfill plant design is provided in Section 24.15.10.Figure 24-5: Phase 1 - Ventilation Schematic for the Development of the Infrastructure and Production Ramp-Up\n![img-61.jpeg](img-61.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure from CGM Mine Ventilation Specialist (2024).Figure 24-6: Phase 2 - Ventilation Schematic for Production\n![img-62.jpeg](img-62.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure from CGM Mine Ventilation Specialist (2024).Figure 24-7: Phase 3 - Ventilation Schematic for the Incremental 1.5 g/t Au Cut-off Grade Material and West Extension\n![img-63.jpeg](img-63.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure from CGM Mine Ventilation Specialist (2024).Figure 24-8: Plan View of the Proposed Paste Plant Location on Surface\n![img-64.jpeg](img-64.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.10 Mine Plan\n\nThe proposed underground mine will be divided into regions according to their location in relation to the open pit (Figure 24-9).\n\nThe underground stope mining sequence was established by region and phase. The goal was to commence production in the Lower Saddle region, next to the crusher and the conveyor. This will allow for the required infrastructure to be available for production startup and should result in a short ramp-up period.\n\nThe proposed phases are:\n\n- Phase 1: development of the main ramp and conveyor to start mining Lower Saddle first, then Upper Saddle and Upper West until full production in 2033;\n- Phase 2: full production of Lower Saddle, Upper Saddle, Upper West, and the Old Workings from 2033 to 2042;\n- Incremental $1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$ cut-off grade material: mineralization inside Lower Saddle, Upper Saddle, Upper West, and the Old Workings not requiring any additional capital development, incorporated into production starting in 2037;\n- West Expansion Phase 1: development is planned to start in 2039 and progress quickly to mine the Upper West Expansion and Lower West Expansion. The design was specially adapted to transition from Upper West, and reflects the potential of a possible West Expansion Phase 2 in the future.\n\nA critical-path development schedule was built to ensure the coordination between the development of the main ramp, the conveyor ramp, the crusher, and the start of the production. To achieve this, four teams will alternate between single face development and dual face development.\n\nOnce a team has completed its critical path, it will become a regular development team and be applied to multi-face development, capped at $325 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{month}$. When production starts per the forecast for Q2 2030, all of the critical paths will be completed.\n\nWith the current mine design, no more than four development teams doing 15,600 m of development per year will be required to reach the full production in 2033 and maintain it thereafter.\n\nTable 24-8 summarizes the proposed underground development schedule. Table 24-9 presents the planned production schedule, which includes a development period (i.e., Y-5 to Y-1) and the production ramp up (i.e., Y1 to Y3) during which the number of stopes mined annually is gradually increased. According to the mine plan, an average of 138 stopes per year is required to feed the process plant once in production.Figure 24-9: Longitudinal View Showing Proposed Mining Regions\n![img-65.jpeg](img-65.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.

The underground mine work schedule assumes two 11-hour shifts. The automated LHDs will be on 12 hour shifts with hot changes to maximize the material extraction.\n\nThe proposed underground equipment list is provided in Table 24-10. The equipment fleet will be diesel-powered. A surface equipment fleet will complement the underground fleet bring in workers and manage the consumables on surface; these requirements are also summarized in Table 24-10.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.14.12 Water Requirements\n\nUnderground industrial water will be supplied by 6-inch service pipes in the ramp.\nTo decrease water consumption and increase site sustainability, water from the dewatering circuit will recirculate and flow back to the supply circuit. Underground industrial water will be used by all types of equipment, such as drills, and for a variety of jobs, such as muck washing (to remove explosives debris, amongst other purposes).\n\nThe water consumption was estimated using the 2024 PEA mine plan, based on the amount of equipment in each year, and those numbers were integrated into the water balance. At the site scale, the water consumption by underground equipment is relatively small (estimated in the order of $400 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} /$ day at $0 \\%$ recirculation rate) compared to other flows, such as the calculated infiltration. In the water balance, the recirculation rate was fixed at $50 \\%$, so a freshwater source of $200 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} /$ day will then be needed.

The flowsheet is based upon unit operations that are well proven in industry.\n\nThe process plant was designed to process ore at an average throughput of $55,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ or $20 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$, equivalent to milling rates of 2,500 tonnes per operating hour ( $\\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{oh}$ ) with operating time of $92 \\%$ in a 24 -hour day. While operating time has lagged at around $90 \\%$, the milling rate has far exceeded the design rate averaging $3,325 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ in 2023 for 25.4 Mt milled. A record throughput day of $88,370 \\mathrm{t}$ was achieved in July 2023.

The underground mineralized material will be temporarily stockpiled near the re-feed ore stockpile.\n\nLoaders and trucks will be used to dose underground mineralized material into the gyratory crusher feed. The strategy is to follow open pit production to ensure good blending of both sources and to control the gold grade feeding the mill. The mobile equipment is already available since it is currently used for the re-feed system.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.15.5 Crushing And Grinding\n\nThe crushing and grinding circuit is in place and operational; however, optimizations are planned or underway.\n\n## Crushing Circuit\n\nThe primary crushing system is a single stage, open circuit, primary gyratory crusher ( 60 x 113 inches). The crusher selection was based on a feed top size of $1,200 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and a product $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of 165 mm . The primary crushing system comprises a single-stage gyratory crusher in open circuit with an apron feeder underneath. At a 125 mm closed side setting, its production rate ranges from 4,200 to $4,500 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{oh}$. Assuming an $80 \\%$ availability, the primary crusher has a capacity of $81-86 \\mathrm{kt} / \\mathrm{d}$; enough for $29 \\mathrm{Mt} /$ year. The live capacity of the feed and discharge hoppers of the gyratory crusher was designed for two truck loads each, assuming a nominal payload of 300 t . The crushed ore storage pile has a live capacity corresponding to approximately $44,000 \\mathrm{t}$ and an overall capacity (live plus dead) of $176,000 \\mathrm{t}$.\n\nOre is reclaimed from the storage pile through two reclaim tunnels, one for each grinding line. Four apron feeders, two in each reclaim tunnel, discharge the crushed ore onto a belt conveyor that feeds a new scalping screen above the secondary crushers. The undersize of the screen goes to the SAG mill feed conveyor, while the oversize feeds the secondary cone crusher operated and then discharged onto the SAG mill feed conveyor. The crushed pebbles are also discharged on the SAG mill feed conveyor as well.\n\nThe secondary crusher is equipped with a bypass chute to maintain high process plant availability. During maintenance of the secondary crusher, the bypass is put into place to feed the SAG mill directly from the stockpile. A re-feed conveyor was installed to minimize the impact on production of having the secondary crushers down. Material of -1 \" is fed to the SAG mill feed conveyor with this system. This system has a capacity of 1,600 t/h.\n\n## Crusher Improvement Initiatives\n\nScalping screens have been added ahead of the secondary crushers. The first consideration for efficient secondary crushing begins with the appropriate feed preparation. Cone crushers achieve their best work when particles smaller than the desired crusher product are already removed. A more efficient head movement can be achieved as the coarse particles are easily broken into smaller particles due to the voids created in the crushing chamber. Fines, on the other hand, consume power, can induce vibrations, and reduce the crusher availability and capacity.\n\nRemoval of fines has unlocked secondary crusher capacity but has also significantly reduced the volumetric feed rate to the crusher. As a result, choke feed conditions are not steadily achieved, which causes uneven mantle wear and lower power utilization. These elements impact size reduction and the availability of the secondary crushers. Improvements can be made to resolve these issues such as the addition of a VFD to thecrusher's motor. This modification aims to regulate the crusher rotation speed in order to maintain power draw and choke feed conditions.\n\nThe 1,000 hp motors installed on the secondary crushers are smaller than the theorical 1,200 hp motor that could be installed on the Raptor XL1100. By increasing the power draw, a finer product could potentially be produced with same crushers. The impact of secondary crusher power draw on throughput rates is very well documented from historical data where each $\\mathrm{kWh}=1.4 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{oh}$.\n\nThe primary crusher is a key area where initiatives are planned to generate a finer product that will translate into a higher plant throughput. The impact of fragmentation on throughput has been well documented and has a very high impact on throughput.\n\nIt has been established that each 50 mm reduction in the $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ equals about a $300 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ increase in plant throughput. In 2019, the mine started a drill-and-blast optimization project that has resulted in higher throughput rates and better operational conditions. The initiative is ongoing as the mine aims to further optimize the process.\n\nThe choke feeding of the primary crusher is another key element to increase the plant throughput milling rates. It has been well established that the longer a crusher stays full, the finer the product will be (choke feeding). A unit of measure was created to measure choke feeding which is the Tons/\\#Empty events. For example, if 50,000 t was crushed and the crusher went empty 100 times, the Ton/\\#Empty event would be 500.\n\nThe primary crusher choke feeding still can be improved. The avenues to do this are to improve dispatching of trucks, better fragmentation to avoid bridging of the crusher, an excavator dedicated to the primary crusher re-feed, and improved rock breaker availability and performance.\n\nThe increased fineness coming from the open pit ore due to improved blasting techniques, caused some issues with the primary crusher as the fines would not flow well and cause power and hydraulic pressure spikes tripping the crusher. Using a Hi-Fines mantle/concave design for the crusher, together with High-Fines mantle liners, will raise the choke zone and fill up more the crushing chamber, which will distribute wear more evenly and generate a finer particle size, and result in reduced power draw and hydraulic pressure reduction. It is planned to install these items once the SAG mill grates are converted to 60 mm (from 70 mm ) and the SAG discharge screen to 8 mm . These modifications are needed to handle the finer product generated by the Hi-Fines mantle/concaves.\n\n# Grinding Circuit \n\nThe SAG mill operates in closed circuit with a pebble crusher while the ball mill operates in closed circuit with hydrocyclones.\n\nThe design circulating load from the cyclones to the ball mill is $250 \\%$ of the SAG mill new feed. The pebble crushing circuit with a design discharge $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of 13 mm processes the equivalent of up to $25 \\%$ of the fresh feed.Around 15\\% of the cyclone feed material is sent to the gravity recovery circuit. Six gravity concentrators with 48 inch bowls were selected (three per grinding line supporting a strategy of two units in operation at all time). A batch-intensive cyanidation system is used to process the gravity concentrate. The extraction performance of gold from the gravity concentrate by the intensive cyanidation system is $90 \\%$. The pregnant solution is pumped to a tank in the gold room followed by electrowinning in a dedicated cell. Modifications are planned to convert the gravity circuit feed from cyclone feed to cyclone underflow. The higher concentration of gold in the cyclone underflow should lead to a higher gravity recovery.\n\nThe target $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ at the cyclone overflow is $130 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, representing the historical value at which the plant has been running. It has been observed that over this value, recovery is impacted. To maintain the ore fineness of the cyclone overflow, the transfer size between the SAG and the ball-mill will have to be reduced. To do so, two modifications are planned to the circuit. First, the installation of smaller SAG discharge grates to keep more material inside the SAG mill and secondly, the reduction of the aperture of the SAG discharge screen panels from 9.5 mm to 8.0 mm . The advanced process control to be installed will also have some features that will control the final grind size.\nIn 2023, a grinding circuit survey was performed and from this the circuit was modelled using JKSimmet software. The simulations using this software have confirmed that at 29 Mt throughput rates and by doing such modifications to the grinding circuit, the $130 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ grind size can be maintained.\n\nOther avenues such as increasing ball-mill power draw, reducing ball-mill density and optimum ball-size will also be explored. The reduced ball-mill hardness from the West and Saddle Zone will also greatly help to maintain the $130 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{P}_{80}$ target when the plant will start processing these zones.\n\n# Advanced Process Control Improvements \n\nMany improvements have been made over the last few years in regard to in-house expert control loops. Several loops are currently used in silos and cannot provide full benefits. Future work will focus on interconnecting the silos to achieve more effective process control. Woodgrove Technologies performed an audit and provided recommendations to this end.\n\n## Pebble Crusher Variable Speed Drives\n\nBy nature, a SAG mill generates pebbles at an uneven rate. The rate is influenced by ore feed size, mill speed and the load inside the mill. As a result, the pebble crusher's power cannot be maximized given the variations in its feed. The crusher is gapped so that it can receive any surges in pebbles. The average power is therefore maintained around 450 kW while the motor is rated for 750 kW . The pebble crusher is rarely choke fed. By installing a VFD on the pebble crusher motors, the speed can be increased and decreased to maintain a set-point of 550 kW for power draw. This will enable the crusher to be choke fed and reduce the particle size discharged from the crusher. With a reduced particle size, theSAG mill throughput will increase. For each kW of pebble crusher power, the SAG milling rate increases by about $0.4 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{h}$ from the current historical data.\n\n# Ore Blending \n\nOre blending is an avenue that the process plant has used successfully to optimize milling rates. About $30 \\%$ of the plant feed is blasted with high intensity and some of it is stockpiled so the daily blend is even at $30 \\%$. However, there are still room to do better and the new avenue that will be explored is machine learning to blend the ore. The machine learning will compare historical plant throughput performance to where the ore is coming from in the pit and make correlations with spatial location and geochemistry. It will predict the zones or area on a bench like area near walls that will give lower throughput. These can either be blasted differently or blended with more high intensity blasted ore. Stabilizing the feed is key to minimize fluctuation in the feed going to the secondary crushers.\nAlso, to improve blending, new ore sizing cameras will be installed at each apron feeders feeding the secondary crushers. Each aprons feeders have different particle size due to the segregation of the ore in the stockpile. On each line, one feeder is usually coarse and the other one fine. These cameras, along with an advanced process control algorithm, will minimize the feed size perturbances to the secondary crushers which will result in improved performance and reduced fineness of the crushed product.\n\n## Increase Plant Operating Time to 92\\%\n\nThe operating time for the process plant is calculated when the ore is on the belt feeding the SAG mills. Although the plant operating time has improved since start-up, the design rate of $92 \\%$ has not yet been achieved over an annual basis, instead averaging around $90 \\%$. This is the result of the constant plant throughput ramp-up, which constantly changes wear patterns. Once the milling rates have stabilized, it is expected that the $92 \\%$ operating time will be achieved.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.15.6 Leach And Carbon-In-Pulp\n\nThe leach and CIP circuit is in place and operational.\nThe gold recovery circuit selected was a leach circuit followed by a CIP circuit. The designed retention time for leaching is 29 hours. The leach feed size was designed at a $\\mathrm{P}_{80}$ of $95 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThe CIP design selected uses a carousel-type system with an average design retention time of 80 minutes in this circuit.\n\nUpgrades to the CIP pumpcells have been done to support the $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate. The variable speed drive and motors for the CIP tails pumps were also upgraded to 500 hp from 350 hp .\n\nThe current adsorption profile and modelling support the planned increase in throughput rate in conjunction with the planned increased elution frequency to maintain carbon gradesbelow $2,500 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$. This will also be supported by the modifications to the gravity recovery to increase gravity recovery from $25 \\%$ to $35 \\%$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.15.7 Acid Wash, Stripping, Electrowinning, And Refining\n\nThe acid wash, stripping, electrowinning, and refining circuit is in place and operational.\nThe stripping system uses a modified version (i.e., on-line electrowinning and no pregnant solution tank) of the high-pressure Zadra process to recover the gold from the loaded carbon.\n\nThe circuit incorporates an acid wash stage and is designed to handle up to 10 t of carbon per day. The acid wash stage is not currently used and will be converted into a plastic removal vessel. The build up of calcium is not sufficient to warrant the use of the acid wash vessel.\n\nThe stripping circuit is designed to handle up to 10 t of carbon per stripping cycle (approximately $8-10$ hours); $100 \\%$ of the carbon is regenerated in two regeneration kilns designed to handle up to 20 t of carbon per day.\n\nThe electrowinning process is done \"in-line\" with the stripping circuit. The flow of pregnant solution is split between three rows of two electrowinning cells. One dedicated electrowinning cell handles the pregnant solution from the ILR tank.\n\nThe refining equipment is designed to handle the gold from the stripping circuit and from the gravity recovery system. The electrowinning sludge is filtered, dried, and mixed with fluxes, before being smelted using induction furnaces.\n\nThe current elution capacity is estimated to be 2.5 strips of 10 t per day. In 2021, 1.75 strips per day were completed. There is sufficient capacity to cover the increased throughput for the LOM.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.15.8 Thickening\n\nThe thickening circuit is in place and operational.\nThe feed to the leach circuit is maintained at a density of $50-55 \\%$ solids by weight using one high rate thickener. The overflow of the pre-leach thickener is recycled to the process water tank. The pre-detox thickener is used to thicken the leach tails slurry to $55-60 \\%$ solids and the overflow is recycled to the process water circuit.\n\nThe thickener capacity is over $90 \\mathrm{kt} / \\mathrm{d}$ and can support the increase throughput without any modifications. Current flocculent consumption is low at $12 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.15.9 Tailings\n\nThe tailings circuit is in place and operational.\nThe underflow of the pre-detox thickener is diluted using reclaim water prior to cyanide destruction. The tailings slurry coming out of the cyanide destruction unit and is pumped into the tailings storage area via two parallel pipelines, each with a maximum flow of2,500 m³/hr each; sufficient to support the increase in throughput to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{d}$. Some minor upgrades to motors and VFD may be needed when going to cell \\#3 of the TMA.\n\nThe selected cyanide destruction process is the Inco $\\mathrm{SO}_{2} /$ air process. Liquid $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ is used with sodium metasulphite as a back up.\n\nA fourth detox tank was installed in 2022 to support the increase in plant throughput.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.15.10 Paste Backfill\n\nThe proposed paste backfill plant will have a design capacity of $12,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ of paste using two production lines of $6,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ each, which is based on the assumption that $75 \\%$ of the underground stope volume will be filled with cemented paste backfill.\nFollowing cyanide destruction, tailings will be piped from the process plant to the paste plant. A split box will divide the flow to the paste plant transfer pump box, from which the slurry will be pumped the 4.8 km distance to the paste plant facility. Unused tailings will be sampled prior to being pumped to the TMA. A water loop system will be implemented to prevent the pipeline from freezing during the winter.\nAt the paste plant, a 25 m high-rate thickener will ensure that a solids density of $60-63 \\%$ is achieved prior to transfer to the surge tank, providing approximately four hours of live capacity at full capacity operation. Each paste backfill line will have two filters with a dedicated vacuum pump system.\n\nFilter cakes will drop onto a single mixer feed conveyor. Each paste mixer will have a volume of $6 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$, providing almost three minutes of residence time. Binders and water will be added according to the specified recipe. The residence time in the mixer will be short to minimize cleaning time and the workforce required for pre-maintenance. Such a short residence time is expected to have no impact on the paste quality. Implementation of a watt transducer is planned, to monitor the mixer's power draw continuously.\n\nAfter mixing, paste will flow by gravity to a positive displacement pump. High-pressure pumps will be needed to cover the long horizontal distances.\n\nThree boreholes will serve to distribute paste to the underground stopes: one directly beneath the paste plant facilities (the so-called central pipeline), a second to the west side, and a third to the east side. Paste can thus be pumped to the appropriate borehole to fill the stopes. Since there will be two paste backfill production lines, no more than two boreholes will operate at the same time. This configuration will facilitate switching quickly from one mine sector to another, by changing boreholes.\n\nThickener overflow, water filtrate or any waste streams that have to be pumped back to the process plant will be sent to the wastewater return pump box. This pump box will also serve to prevent freezing in the water loop system.\n\nPig launcher systems will be included to clean the feed and return pipelines as needed.Feed and waste pipeline design takes into account the significant variations in flowrate, i.e., $12,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ and $6,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ paste production capacity. Half tonnage production rates will occur when a single paste backfill line is in operation.\nWastewater returns will be pumped directly to the process plant final tails pump box and will not be sampled.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.15.11 Energy, Water, And Process Materials Requirements\n\n## Power\n\nEnergy consumption is not expected to significantly increase as a result of the increased throughput rate. A lot of the initiatives to increase plant throughput are related to increases in grinding efficiency with the same power. The increase in energy consumption is mostly related to the increase in run time.\n\nThe historical plant power consumption for the plant from 2018-2023 as:\n\n- 2018: 680,198 MWh for $20.7 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.033 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2019: 713,723 MWh for $22.0 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.032 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2020: 710,252 MWh for $23.0 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.031 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2021: 711,048 MWh for $24.1 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.030 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2022: 737,388 MWh for $25.5 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.029 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$;\n- 2023: 735,160 MWh for $25.4 \\mathrm{Mt}, 0.029 \\mathrm{MWh} / \\mathrm{t}$.\n\nThe 2024 PEA plan assumes that the $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ throughput rate will use 778,000 MWh per year, which the plant electrical system is adequately designed to supply.\n\n## Water\n\nA barge reclaim water system is used to reclaim and pump water from the TMA back to the process plant to satisfy process water requirements. Depending on the water balance in the TMA, water from the open pit and various collection ditches around the WRSFs can also be directed to the plant.\n\nMake-up water for the reagent mixing is sourced from East Lake when required.\n\n## Consumables\n\nSeveral reagent systems were incorporated into the plant design to provide the requirements for the different process areas, which include grinding, leaching, intensive cyanidation, CIP, stripping and refining, thickening, and cyanide destruction. Reagents are listed as follows:\n\n- Steel balls for grinding media;\n- Quicklime $(\\mathrm{CaO})$ for pH control;- Sodium cyanide $(\\mathrm{NaCN})$ for gold dissolution and desorption;\n- $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and sodium metabisulfite for cyanide destruction;\n- Anti-scalant for process water and strip solution;\n- Caustic for pH adjustment for the strip solution, cyanide mixing and ILR solution;\n- Copper sulphate to start cyanide destruction reaction;\n- Activated carbon for gold adsorption;\n- Lead nitrate for maximizing gold extraction and reducing cyanide consumption during leaching;\n- Oxygen (VPSA and liquid as back-up) for gold leaching;\n- Flocculant polymers for efficient settling in thickeners;\n- Ore anti-freeze conditioner; added in winter.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.16 Infrastructure\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.16.1 Overview\n\n## Existing Infrastructure\n\nSurface infrastructure to support operations is primarily in place, and includes:\n\n- Two open pits: Detour Lake (in operation) and North Pit (to be constructed);\n- Processing facilities (in operation): grinding and leaching facilities, along with management and engineering offices, change house, workshop, warehouse, and assay laboratory facilities;\n- Mine facilities (in operation): management and engineering offices, change house, heavy mining vehicle and light vehicle workshops, wash bay, warehouse, explosives magazine, crusher, mine access gate house, return water pump house;\n- Administration buildings (in operation): facilities for overall site management, safety inductions, and general and administrative functions;\n- Accommodation camp (in operation);\n- Four stockpiles: ROM pad (in operation), MRS4 (in construction), MRS5 (to be built) and MRS2 SP (in operation);\n- Four WRSFs: MRS1 (in operation), MRS2 (in operation), MRS3 (to be built) and inpit (to be built);\n- Four tailings storage facilities: cells 1 (filled up), 2 (in operation), 3 (to be built) and 4 (to be built);- Water management facilities (in operation): stormwater and water storage dams, diversions, culverts;\n- Landfill facility (in operation);\n- Airfield and aerodrome facility (in operation).\n\nA layout plan showing the facilities constructed to support mining operations is provided in Figure 24-11.\n\n# Proposed Infrastructure In Support of 2024 PEA \n\nAdditional infrastructure will be required to support the assumptions in the 2024 PEA:\n\n- Access portals;\n- Conveying system;\n- Two surface conveyors;\n- Paste plant;\n- Administration buildings and mine dry;\n- Warehouse and cold storage building;\n- Maintenance shop;\n- Expansion of accommodation facilities;\n- Compressor room;\n- Ventilation raises, ventilation support and heating;\n- Electrical substations and distribution lines;\n- IT and site communications;\n- Combustible and fuel storage.\n\nA layout plan showing the facilities to be constructed to support the 2024 PEA mining operations is provided in Figure 24-12.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.16.2 Existing Infrastructure\n\n## Road and Logistics\n\nA discussion of the access routes was provided in Section 5.1.\nSite access is provided through a guard/security house located at the entrance to the site on the main access road. Visitor car and truck parking bays are provided adjacent to the guard house. The guard house is equipped with radio and telephone communication and is continuously manned.Figure 24-11:Existing Infrastructure Layout Plan\n![img-67.jpeg](img-67.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2022.Figure 24-12: Infrastructure Layout Plan to Support 2024 PEA\n![img-68.jpeg](img-68.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.# Tailings Management Area \n\nTMA Cell 1 and Cell 2 are located approximately 2 km east-northeast of the Detour Lake open pit. TMA Cell 1 contains approximately 153 Mt of tailings. The facilities are discussed in Section 24.18.3.\n\n## Mine Site Built Infrastructure\n\n## Mine Service Facilities\n\nThe mine service facilities are sufficient to support maintenance of the current mining operations fleet. It is located approximately 1.2 km south of the process plant. The largest floor space allocation is for the workshop and work-bays. The workshop is currently undergoing and expansion of four additional work-bays, two for haul trucks, and two for welding.\n\nAn appropriately-sized truck wash facility was constructed adjacent to the mine service facilities building to allow for washing and cleaning of heavy equipment prior to maintenance taking place.\n\nIn proximity to the mine service facilities and truck wash buildings are a diesel and gasoline fuel storage and re-fueling station.\n\n## Process Plant\n\nThe process plant comprises three main buildings (the primary crushing building, the secondary and pebble crushing building and the main process plant building). Additional process facilities are located adjacent to these buildings.\n\nThe primary crushing building is located approximately 450 m to the northeast of the eastern Detour Lake Pit limit. Adjacent to the primary crusher, a ROM stockpile with an approximate 12 Mt capacity was established to help manage the crusher downtime. The crusher building houses the gyratory crusher and the tail end of the stockpile feed conveyor. The crushed ore stockpile has a capacity of approximately 176,000 t. Under the stockpile, two reclaim tunnels were installed for the conveyors to recover the crushed material.\n\nEach conveyor reclaims crushed ore from the stockpile to a secondary crusher located in the secondary and pebble crusher building. In this building, a conveyor collects both secondary and pebble secondary crusher undersize to convey the ore to the SAG mill. Both secondary crushers and pebble crushers are equipped with shuttle chutes and bypass chutes to enable maintenance of crushers without stopping a grinding line.\n\nThere is a separate \"re-feed\" system that enables ore to bypass of the primary crusher. Crushed ore is fed into a feeder that is deposited onto the conveyor belt between the dome and secondary crusher. This system allows material to be fed into the mill while the primary crusher is unavailable.\n\nThe main process plant building houses the grinding, CIP, gravity and intensive cyanidation, reagents, stripping, electrowinning, refining areas, compressors as well as tailings pumps. The leach tanks are located north of the main process building between the thickeners. Thetanks are arranged in two sets of 10 tanks (four rows of five tanks) on a large containment concrete pad.\n\nThe process staff offices are located within the main process plant. This office complex also houses a conference room, lunch room, change rooms, washrooms, documentation room and a metallurgical laboratory. The plant maintenance shops are located on the first and second floors of the main process plant building on the south side of the grinding area.\n\n# Administration \n\nSite administration facilities are incorporated within the mine service facilities, and include offices, warehouse, change rooms, and showers. In addition, the building also includes the emergency services area (an examination room, a treatment room, and a covered garage houses the ambulance).\n\n## Explosives Plant\n\nDyno Nobel operates a bulk explosives plant approximately 3.5 km west of the process plant. The designed manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet the operation's requirements.\n\n## Off-Site Built Infrastructure\n\nFacilities in Cochrane include administration offices, a bus terminal with employee parking lot and security check-ins, four houses and an eight-unit apartment block. Agnico Eagle has a shared services centre in Timmins that services the Detour Lake Mine.\n\nSGS Minerals operates a full-service analytical laboratory in Cochrane in support of the Detour Lake Mine.\n\n## Camp and Accommodations\n\nWorkers are accommodated in two camps. The Little Hopper Lodge (previously referred to as the Permanent Camp) has a capacity of 611 rooms and is located 7 km west of the mining operations near Little Hopper Lake.\n\nThe Sagimeo Lodge is located just south of the mine services building and has a capacity of 824 rooms.\n\nThere is also an overflow camp with 275 additional rooms available.\n\n## Communications\n\nA fibre optic link provides internet access and VoIP phone connectivity to the Detour Lake Mine and connects all facilities to the Agnico Eagle offices in Cochrane and Toronto. Voice and data at site are connected via 5G LTE private network. This network has fullyredundant fibre optic backbones and microwave link backup. Satellite phones and copperlines are used as emergency backup communication methods in the event of fibre optic service disruptions.# Water Management \n\nThe existing water management system was designed to minimize the amount of fresh water (non-contact water) required to operate the mine and process plant and to minimize discharge of treated contact water to the environment. Currently water management infrastructure is also designed to segregate and recycle water that has been in contact with process reagents (process water), this water is fully contained within the TMA in a closed loop and never discharged to the receiving environment.\n\nContact water from the open pit is captured in a collection of sumps and pumped through a network of piping to one of two sediment collection ponds on the surface. Water from old underground workings is also dewatered using a borehole and pumped into one of the pit sumps before being transferred to the surface collection ponds. There are seven perimeter dewatering wells that are drilled and awaiting permits for pumping. Water in the sediment collection ponds is then either used to supplement water for the mill or transferred to the mine water pond.\n\nStockpile runoff is managed using a series of collection ditches and ponds. Stockpiles are encompassed by ditches that gravity feed to ponds located at topographic lows. Runoff collected in these ponds is then pumped through a network of piping to one of the sediment ponds where it is either used to supplement water for the mill or transferred to the mine water pond.\n\nThe mine water pond serves as a central water management facility (e.g., for open pit water and local runoff), and provides additional contingencies for storage and treatment, if needed. Additional details on water management and discharge considerations can be found in Section 24.18.4.\n\n## Water Supply\n\nPotable water for the Little Hopper Lodge is obtained from Little Hopper Lake, adjacent to the lodge, and processed through a water purification plant. This is adequate for the mine's current and future needs.\n\nPotable water for the Sagimeo Lodge, mine services facilities, site administration facility, and the process plant is obtained from borehole wells close to the camp, and processed through a water purification plant.\n\nFresh water is pumped from East Lake. This water is primarily used in the process plant for reagent mixing but is also used as wash water in the truck wash facility and water makeup for the fire water tank.\n\n## Power Supply\n\nThe existing 180 km long powerline runs from the processing facility to a tie in at Island Falls, and thence to the Pinard substation. The 230 kV transmission line currently allows for the distribution of up to 165 MW of power, suitable to service the entire Detour Lakemining operation. In the event of a power failure, there is sufficient emergency power generation for the provision of basic services.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.16.3 Planned Infrastructure In Support Of 2024 Pea\n\nMost infrastructure will be located directly at the mine site; however, some offsite infrastructure must be upgraded to accommodate the underground mine proposed in the 2024 PEA.\n\n## Services and Conveyor Portals\n\nThere will be two access areas to the proposed underground mine:\n\n- The main access for services and mining teams will be situated northwest of the current open pit operation (refer to Figure 24-12). It is planned to develop the ramp portal to provide early underground access. A layout plan is included as Figure 24-13;\n- The materials handing access for the $15,000 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$ conveying system will be located east of the open pit operation, relatively close to the process plant (refer to Figure 24-12). The conveyor portal will be built later during the construction phase, as it is only needed for the conveyor installation prior to operation. A layout plan is included as Figure 24-14.\n\n\n## Conveyor\n\nTwo surface conveyors are planned:\n\n- Material will be transferred from the 4.5 km -long underground conveyor to a transfer tower. This transfer tower can be adjusted to drop material onto one or the other discharge conveyor. Waste will be handled by a conveyor that will discharge onto a stockpile to be handled by open pit mine loaders and trucks;\n- A mineralized material conveyor will discharge mineralized material onto a stockpile near the existing dome beside the processing plant. The mineralized material conveyor will be in an enclosed structure, but the waste conveyor will not. The stockpiled material will then be loaded into the gyratory crusher using a wheel loader to feed the process plant.\n\n\n## Paste Plant\n\nThe paste plant design considerations are discussed in Section 24.14.9 and 24.15.10.\n\n## Administration Buildings and Mine Dry\n\nA construction service building will be assembled on four containers close to the service ramp for the preliminary development phase, to centralize all the equipment required for ramp development.Figure 24-13:Proposed Services Ramp (West Ramp) Area Layout\n![img-69.jpeg](img-69.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.Figure 24-14:Proposed Conveyor Ramp (East Ramp) Area Layout\n![img-70.jpeg](img-70.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.The containers will house:\n\n- HVAC system for heating and ventilation;\n- Electrical distribution;\n- Water storage tanks;\n- General storage.\n\nTrailers will be used for office space for underground staff, contractors, and for a temporary dry.\n\nThe proposed operations building will be a two-storey steel erected building with offices, conference rooms, a workers' dry and lunch room.\n\n# Warehouse and Maintenance Shop \n\nThe planned warehouse will be a re-purposed building from the open pit operation, to be installed adjacent the operations building.\n\nA cold storage building will be needed early, so that the material purchased for the preliminary underground development will not be left outside in the rain, snow, and dust. This building will be erected near the planned laydown area.\n\nDuring the preliminary underground development phase, contractor staff will be equipped with their own mobile equipment fleet. Since there will be no maintenance infrastructure near the service ramp portal, the contractor is assumed to provide their own maintenance shop. Civil works, foundations and all other services will be provided by Agnico Eagle.\n\nFollowing the preliminary underground development phase, Agnico Eagle will purchase underground mobile equipment and will carry out its own maintenance. A maintenance shop will be built at surface with access to the operations building and warehouse.\n\nThe planned six-bay maintenance shop will be used for the major maintenance of the underground mining equipment. There will also be two underground maintenance areas and one underground maintenance shop.\n\nA tool crib, lube/oil distribution system and compressed air distribution system will be installed in the truck shop. The truck shop will include a kitting area, conference room, planner/supervisor office and toilets. The wash bay will be located underground to facilitate water management. Tires will be managed in another small building to be constructed near the maintenance shop.\n\n## Facilities Complex\n\nThe 2024 PEA will require three additional wings to be constructed at the existing Sagimeo accommodations camp.# Compressor Room \n\nTwo compressed air setups are required:\n\n- Temporary: used during the preliminary development stage. Will consist of two skid-mounted 750 CFM air compressors linked with an appropriate air dryer and air receiver. A stench gas system, a CO detector and a de-icing system will also be included on the compressed air skid;\n- Permanent: used during later stages of development and during operation. Will consist of six 2000 CFM compressors to be installed near the service ramp portal. Four will have fixed speeds (3 operating, 1 standby), and two (1 operating, 1 standby) will be on a variable speed drive to help accommodate fluctuations in compressed air demand.\n\nThe compressed air will be connected to the underground with insulated piping at surface to the service ramp portal prior to the underground mine distribution.\n\n## Permanent Ventilation and Heating\n\nVentilation raises at surface will be required for underground ventilation.\nDuring operation, three raises will be required to provide ventilation underground: one intake raise and two exhaust raises. The fresh air intake raise will be 7.5 m in diameter and be located south of the service ramp, just south of the current access road. At surface, the primary ventilation unit will be installed with propane heaters, which are required to heat the fresh air. The primary ventilation unit will consist of two 2,300 hp fans coupled with burners having a total capacity of $112 \\mathrm{MBTU} / \\mathrm{h}$. The maximum airflow requirement during the LOM is calculated at $1,203 \\mathrm{kCFM}$.\n\nPropane tanks will be required to feed heating capacity to the burners.\nTwo 5 m -diameter (minimum) exhaust raises will also be required east and west of the service ramp.\n\n## Electrical Distribution\n\nNew electrical substations will be required to support the 2024 PEA. A new $13.8 \\mathrm{kV} / 34.5 \\mathrm{kV}$ @ 20/26.7/33.3 MVA substation will be located close to the site's main $230 \\mathrm{kV} / 13.8 \\mathrm{kV}$ electrical substation, and will be dedicated to the underground operations.\n\nAn aerial power line will link that new substation to the new substation that will be located on the underground services pad. The latter will be a $34.5 \\mathrm{kV} / 13.8 \\mathrm{kV}$ @ 20/26.7/33.3 MVA substation.\n\nThe main underground E-room will be connected to this substation to distribute power at 13.8 kV for remote and large loads (paste plant, main ventilation, multiservice building, underground mine) and at 600 V for nearby surface infrastructure. The grounding grid, to isolate the underground electrical network, will also be connected to this substation.The conveyor ramp infrastructure will be powered by existing 13.8 kV aerial power lines.\nThere will be smaller, remote substations, including one 5 MVA substation for the primary ventilation and one for the conveyor ramp infrastructure, which will be housed in a prefabricated building or container, based on the equipment and power requirements needed for the area they will serve.\n\nThe substation for electrical distribution to the paste plant will be integrated into the paste plant itself. This will also be a 5 MVA substation. Other small loads will be supplied by pole transformers.\n\nAll substations will have local distribution transformers and panels that will provide the 600/347 V and 120/208 V power required for small tools, control voltages, building lighting, area lighting, building HVAC, IT equipment and other small loads.\n\n# IT and Site Communications \n\nThe telecommunications infrastructure required for the 2024 PEA will link up with the current Detour Lake operation using the same technology, i.e., fibre optic cables installed on power line poles. These fibre optic cables will follow along the electric transmission lines.\n\nWi-Fi network infrastructure will be in place to support computer and telephone operations.\nA private long-term evolution radio system will be deployed for the construction, and surface and underground operation phases, providing coverage of the process infrastructure and mine site.\n\n## Combustible and Fuel Storage\n\nThe 2024 PEA will require two 30,000 L fuel tanks to be installed close to the service ramp portal for a total of 60,000 L dedicated to underground mining operations. The tanks will be used to fuel the underground mobile equipment.\n\nA fuel borehole will be built close to the proposed paste plant, and will supply two underground fuel bays.\n\nAn existing tank farm near the conveyor ramp will be used to refuel smaller mobile equipment, mainly personnel carriers and tractors. During the excavation of the conveyor ramp, it will also be used by all the required mobile equipment.\n\nFor the construction and ramp development phase, one 40,000 L propane tank will be installed close to the construction services building to meet the needs of the temporary underground ventilation burner and construction services building heating.\n\nOnce the intake raise is built and the primary ventilation fans installed, another 40,000 L propane tank will be installed to feed the primary ventilation system burners.\n\nFor the conveyor ramp development, a third 40,000 L propane tank will be installed to feed the relocated temporary underground ventilation system.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.17 Market Studies And Contracts\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.17.1 Market Studies\n\nNo market studies are currently relevant as the Detour Lake Mine is an operating mine producing a readily-saleable commodity in the form of doré. Doré is sent via secure transportation to a refinery for further refining.\n\nAgnico Eagle sells its gold production into the market at spot prices.\nIt is expected that the 2024 PEA will use the same methodology as the existing operations.\nThe estimated bullion transport costs, liability charges and refining costs used for the 2024 PEA financial analysis are based on contract prices agreed with third parties.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.17.2 Commodity Prices\n\nCommodity prices used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are set by Agnico Eagle at the corporate level.\nThe gold price used for the Mineral Resource estimate was US\\$1,650/oz Au, with an exchange rate assumption of $1.30 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$$. The potentially-mineable stope shapes were constrained using a gold price of US\\$1,400/oz Au and an exchange rate assumption of 1.30 C\\$/US\\$.

Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed. Contract terms are considered to be within industry norms, and typical of similar contracts in Canada with which Agnico Eagle is familiar. It is assumed that the 2024 PEA would use similar contracts and contract terms to those already in place.Table 24-13: Material Contracts Currently in Place\n\n| Product | Supplier | Status of Contract |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Heavy equipment (CAT) parts and maintenance | Toromont Industries Ltd. | MARC contract, support agreement, stock, and parts inventory management |\n| Diesel | Imperial Oil | Supply agreement |\n| Plant reagents | Covoro Mining Solutions Canada (cyanide) <br> Univar Canada Ltd.

Metal prices were set corporately for Mineral Resource estimation, for the inputs into the potentially mineable shapes used in the 2024 PEA mine plan, and for the 2024 PEA financial analysis;\n- The QP has reviewed commodity pricing assumptions, marketing assumptions and the current major contract areas, and considers the information acceptable for usein estimating Mineral Reserves and in the economic analysis that supports the 2024 PEA.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.18 Environmental Studies, Permitting And Social Or Community Impact\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.18.1 Environmental And Supporting Studies\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine area has been subject to extensive baseline, environmental monitoring, and technical studies, as per provincial and federal regulatory requirements. Studies and monitoring included:\n\n- Climate;\n- Air quality and noise;\n- Topography, physiography, and geology;\n- Geochemical characterization;\n- Hydrology and hydrogeology;\n- Surface water and groundwater quality;\n- Aquatic life (fish and benthic invertebrates);\n- Terrestrial vegetation;\n- Wildlife;\n- Archeological assessment.\n\nMonitoring of various environmental factors has continued throughout the operating period, generating an extensive environmental dataset that supports site management. This information is also used in support of the 2024 PEA.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.18.2 Site Monitoring\n\nThe mining operations have a number of site monitoring activities in place. The 2024 PEA envisaged that this monitoring would continue throughout the proposed 2024 PEA mine life.\n\n## Air Quality and Noise\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine site is remote from off-property human receptors (permanent and seasonal residences and commercial establishments); hence there are no restrictions on air and noise emissions relative to human receptors. The mine is required to comply with air quality standards, point of impingement guidelines, and ambient air quality criteria specified in Ontario Reg. 419/05. The installed operating monitoring systems assess compliance with these standards, which confirms the predictions of no significant air quality or noise impacts. Air quality and noise modelling undertaken for the Detour Lake pit (former West Detour Project), consolidated pit and underground operations predicted that the project would comply with the required provincial standards and criteria.# Geochemistry \n\nDue to historical mining in the region, the geological materials (i.e., ore, waste rock, tailings, and overburden) relevant to Detour Lake Mine have undergone multiple metal leaching and acid rock drainage (MLARD) assessments by various investigators. Sampling, analysis, and interpretation have followed best-practice, industry-standard methods. In general, MLARD potential at Detour Lake Mine was predicted to be low. Mine waste materials (i.e., waste rock and tailings) continue to undergo regular geochemical monitoring to allow for comparison to predictions and to inform adaptive management, if required.\n\n## Ground Water, Surface Water and Aquatic Resources\n\nDetour Lake Mine has several programs designed to be protective of environmental water quality. The monitoring network includes approximately 87 surface water stations and 152 groundwater stations. Regular data collection, analysis, and interpretation allow for risk identification and adaptive management.\n\nParameters associated with waste rock weathering have been observed in surface waters in the Karel Creek, Linden Creek, Easter Creek, Deem Creek, and East Creek watersheds. Parameter levels were not deemed to be of concern because they were either below water quality guidelines, within or similar to baseline range, and/or engineered controls have shown to be effective following implementation. There have been no significant changes to surface water quality related to current mining operations in the Sunday Lake and Lower Detour watersheds, indicating that any significant trends were localized to the mine site and do not extend beyond the site watershed boundaries.\n\nDevelopment of the Detour Lake Mine site affected some fisheries and other aquatic resources through the displacement or alteration of fish habitat. Mitigation measures are implemented to limit potential effects related to mining on aquatic resources. For the existing Detour Lake Mine, a fish compensation plan was approved by the federal and provincial regulatory agencies, following full consultation with Indigenous communities, to address impacts related to the development of the Tailings Management Area (TMA) and mine rock stockpiles. Additional mitigation measures and compensations plans are being evaluated and proposed to address potential impacts to fisheries and other aquatic resources related to continued development of Detour Lake Mine (e.g., the West Detour Project). These are in the final stages of regulatory review. Required regulatory approvals will be obtained prior to proposed development.\n\nConcentrations of groundwater quality parameters in the Karel Creek, Linden Creek, Easter Creek, East Creek, Sunday Lake, Deem Lake, and Lower Detour watersheds have generally been below environmental monitoring screening criteria where applicable. Based on sampling results to date and comparison to previous data, there have been no significant changes to the groundwater quality, except for potential seepage to groundwater in the vicinity of TMA Cell 1, which is being addressed through a detailed investigation. There are no local groundwater users in the immediate area that could potentially be affected by mining activities.The Detour Lake Mine is committed to continuous improvement through monitoring and the identification and mitigation of risks to the receiving environment.\n\n# Vegetation and Wildlife \n\nPotential impacts to vegetation and wildlife are linked as the principal mine-related impacts to wildlife typically involve habitat alterations. Measures to minimize adverse effects to area plants and wildlife include but are not limited to: minimizing the project footprint; maintaining a minimum 120 m buffer around watercourses where possible; avoidance of unnecessary disturbance to wetlands; and avoidance of tree clearing during the bird nesting period.\nIn addition, there are a number of habitat and wildlife considerations linked to Woodland Caribou, which has been identified as a species at risk. Recommendations for the protection of Woodland Caribou include, as reasonable:\n\n- Minimizing the overall project footprint;\n- Avoidance of critical over-wintering habitat;\n- Minimizing disturbance to mature upland black spruce-jack pine forests that support a high abundance of terrestrial and arboreal lichens (a preferred food source);\n- Minimizing the potential for caribou/vehicular traffic interaction.\n\nA caribou tracking and monitoring program has also been implemented by Detour Lake Mine. In 2023, Agnico Eagle was issued a permit under the Ontario Endangered Species Act for the development of the West Detour Project. This permit outlines mitigation and compensation requirements related to further development of the mine within caribou habitat.\n\n## Cultural and Heritage Resources\n\nArchaeological investigations were historically carried out for the mine access road associated with the previous operation, and more recently as part of baseline investigations. These studies included Indigenous participation. None of the initial baseline studies identified archaeological sites proximal to Detour Lake Mine that are likely to be affected by the mine in any foreseeable manner.\n\nAn additional study conducted in late 2023 identified an archaeological site on the south shore of East Lake, which remains outside of any planned development for the mine.\nThe overall potential for encountering unforeseen cultural heritage or archaeological sites that would conflict with the proposed development plan for the site is considered to be low.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.18.3 Tailings Management Area\n\nThe TMA is currently in place. A description of the components is included in the following sub-sections. The 2024 PEA envisages that all of the tailings from the underground operations can be stored in the existing TMA as currently planned, or using the planned open pit storage, using existing facilities.# Tailings Management Area \n\nTailings are stored at surface in an engineered TMA that is presently located east of the process plant. The TMA consists of four cells being developed in a planned, progressive manner:\n\n- Cell 1 was built over a historic tailings storage facility from a previous mining operation and deposition is fundamentally complete. Progressive reclamation of the facility has commenced;\n- Cell 2 was developed to the north of Cell 1 and is currently the active facility for tailings deposition;\n- The Cell 3 area is proposed to be south of the existing mine water pond, and is currently in permitting and detailed design stage;\n- Cell 4 is proposed south of the existing Cell 1 and is the current area of the mine water pond.\n\nThe TMA is designed to function as four independent cells for tailings and water management. Tailings deposition will generally occur in only one cell at any time with staged deposition to the next cell in transition years. Tailings water recycled and reclaimed for the process plant use will mainly occur from the active cell. Water from the inactive cells will be transferred to active cells until final closure of each facility.\n\nThe initial design of the TMA was optimized during ongoing operations, as additional information became available through ongoing construction and in response to a requirement for additional capacity. In Q4 2020, tailings deposition was transitioned from Cell 1 to Cell 2. Transition from Cell 2 to Cell 3 is planned for 2029 followed by Cell 4 in 2037.\n\nStarting in 2044, tailings are to be deposited in the Detour Main Pit (mining operations in the Detour Main Pit are forecast to be complete in 2044). The TMA Cell 2, Cell 3 and Cell 4, and former open pit will provide for storage of approximately 893 Mt of tailings solids. Capital investment is reflected in the cash flow model.\n\nThe general design and operating practices are as follows:\n\n- The tailings produced will be approximately 29 Mt per annum from 2024 for the remainder of the mine life. Tailings will be pre-treated for cyanide destruction at the process plant and pumped from there through a surface pipeline to the TMA;\n- Tailings will be pumped as slurry and deposited in the active cell primarily by enddumping to form smooth tailings beaches while progressively sloping the tailings surface to direct drainage towards the spillway. A total of 661 Mt will be stored in Cell 2,3 and 4 up to 2044 when in-pit tailings deposition is expected in the Detour Main Pit. A total of 232 Mt of tailings is expected to be deposited in the Detour Main Pit;- The design maximizes the tailings storage volume while minimizing the dam height, with dams being raised in stages to support use of waste rock produced during operations (and thereby reducing stockpiling requirements);\n- The dams are designed for the most severe flood and earthquake criteria, being the probable maximum flood and the maximum credible earthquake in accordance with the Canadian Dam Association Guidelines;\n- An emergency spillway that meets the probable maximum flood is maintained for each dam lift and for each tailings cell. This ensures water can be discharged in an emergency situation without overtopping and eroding the dam;\n- The TMA dams have a low permeability element(s) to provide for efficient water management and to minimize seepage rates;\n- Detailed design documents are provided to applicable regulatory authorities for review and approval in advance of each lift of the dam.\n\nThe TMA currently serves as the central water management facility for local runoff, tailings slurry water, mine water, and water reclaimed for operation of the process plant. The regulatory approval applications, submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks for amended environmental compliance approval \\#4914-CDY826 and Ministry of Mines for dam approval, provide the approved detailed design and should be referred to for design details. On an annual basis, the regulatory authorities receive operational information on water quality and receiving environment monitoring (annual environmental compliance approval report submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks), annual Operation, Maintenance, and Surveillance Manual updates, and geotechnical information on the dams (annual as-built report submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Mines).\n\n# Cell 1 \n\nDeposition of tailings in TMA Cell 1 began in 2013 and continued into Q4 2020. Ultimate dam crest elevation ranges from 320 to 322 masl and storage of 153.1 Mt. TMA Cell 1 was constructed in a series of annual raises intended to provide capacity for tailings as needed and to maintain sufficient freeboard on the dams. The final raise, Stage 8, was completed in 2019.\n\n## Cell 2\n\nCell 2 is the second cell for tailings storage. The construction for the starter dam (Stage 1) was completed in 2020. The Stage 5 raise will be ongoing throughout 2024. The dam comprises a silty sand to sandy silt till core with graded granular chimney and blanket filters downstream of the core. The upstream and downstream shells of the Cell 2 starter dam consist of mine run rockfill with upstream and downstream slopes of $2 \\mathrm{H}: 1 \\mathrm{~V}$. The total length of the Cell 2 starter dam is 8.5 km and abuts the existing Cell 1 Dam. At full capacity, Cell 2 will provide containment for 245 Mt of dry tailings and an operating pond volume of $5 \\mathrm{Mm}^{3}$,corresponding to an ultimate dam crest elevation of 324 masl. Deposition of tailings in TMA Cell 2 began in Q4 2020.\n\nSubsequent raises beyond the Cell 2 starter dam crest elevation of 290 m will be accomplished by means of a downstream raised rockfill shell with a geomembrane liner on the upstream face of the dam, with the final lift subject to ongoing optimization. Table 24-14 summarizes the proposed raise schedule.\n\n# Cell 3 \n\nCell 3 is presently in the conceptual design and permitting stage. Construction, design, and capacity estimates have been completed based on the Cell 2 for inclusion in both the mine plan and cost model. Construction of Cell 3 is scheduled to start in 2027 with a similar design and raising methodology as Cell 2. Cell 3 will provide containment for 208 Mt of dry tailings.\n\n## Cell 4\n\nCell 4 is presently in the conceptual design stage and is being studied and sited in the TMA. Construction, design, and capacity estimates have been completed based on the Cell 2 for inclusion in both the mine plan and cost model. Cell 4 construction will commence in 2034 with similar design and raising methodology as both Cell 2 and 3. Cell 4 will provide a minimum of 208 Mt of dry tailings storage.\n\n## Open Pit\n\nOpen pit tailings storage is presently being studied and sited based on the proposed mine plan and geotechnical constraints of in-pit tailings storage. Open pit tailings storage is expected to commence in 2044. The former open pit provides adequate storage capacity for the remaining LOM and is currently projected to store a minimum of 232 Mt of dry tailings.\nThe open pit tailings storage capacity is sufficient for storage of tailings from underground mine production as envisaged in the 2024 PEA.\n\n## Performance Monitoring\n\nPerformance monitoring in place for the current operations are envisaged to continue for the duration of the 2024 PEA mine plan.\n\nInspection and monitoring activities are performed during construction and operation of the tailings dams to assess their performance and safety; and to verify that actual conditions are consistent with the design assumptions and intentions. Inspection and monitoring also optimizes maintenance and repair costs, provides warning of potential impending risks, and provides sufficient time to implement remedial measures, if required.Table 24-14: Cell 2 TMA Raise Schedule\n\n| Raising Sequence <br> (Calendar Year) | Crest Elevation <br> (m) | Cumulative <br> Tailings <br> Tonnage <br> (Mt) | Operating Pond <br> Allowance <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{M m}^{\\mathbf{3}}\\right)$ | EDF Storage <br> Allowance <br> $\\left(\\mathbf{M m}^{\\mathbf{3}}\\right)$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Stage 5 raise (2024) | 305 | 132.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 6 raise (2025) | 310 | 161.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 7 raise (2026) | 314 | 190.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 8 raise (2027) | 318 | 219.6 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n| Stage 9 raise (2028) | Varies, 320 to 324 | 245 | 5.0 | 2.4 |\n\nA dam safety review completed in 2020 confirmed that the TMA Cell 1 is performing as designed. An updated dam safety review is scheduled for Cell 1, Cell 2, and the mine water pond in 2025.\n\nDam safety inspections are completed on an annual basis by external geotechnical consultants. In addition, various dam safety inspections are conducted on a monthly, weekly, and daily basis by operational staff at the mine.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.18.4 Water Management\n\nThe 2024 PEA envisages that the current water management practices will continue for the duration of the 2024 PEA mine plan.\n\nOperational water management, risk assessment, and mitigation planning are informed by:\n\n- The integrated surface water-groundwater model, which captures hydrological and hydrogeological information to characterize and predict flows (e.g., pit draw down, water level fluctuations in the local watershed);\n- The water balance/water quality model captures water quantity and quality for both the operating and post-closure periods, under average, wet and dry conditions. The model considers sources from the TMA, open pit, and mine rock stockpiles, and other sources. This information is used to ensure sufficient water is available to operate the process plant, manage the volume of water in the TMA and mine water pond, and identify effluent discharge requirements.\n\nEnvironmental protection is ensured through the water management network, which collects seepage and runoff from all mine waste facilities through a system of ditching, pumping, and pipeline infrastructure. The modular design allows for the addition of treatment facilities if required. A mine water pond with a capacity of $3.5 \\mathrm{Mm}^{3}$ serves as a central water management facility (e.g., for open pit water and local runoff), and provides additional contingencies for storage and treatment, if needed.\n\nTailings, tailings slurry water, and water reclaimed for the operation of the process plant are managed through the TMA. The water management objectives for the TMA are as follows:- Provide adequate retention time for control of total suspended solids prior to reclaiming water for process plant use;\n- Optimize reclaim water volume for process plant operations;\n- Allow for settling of suspended solids and natural degradation of ammonia in a separate mine water pond if and when effluent discharge to the environment is required;\n- Handle upset conditions and/or runoff generated from major storm events.\n\nWater is continuously reclaimed back to the plant site for processing needs using two barges with pumping facilities located on the tailings pond. Make-up water for the operation of the process plant is sourced from the mine water pond, mine dewatering and the East Lake when required.\n\nThe TMA is designed to contain runoff resulting from an environmental design flood. As a minimum, the environmental design flood was selected as the 1:100 year 15-day spring maximum runoff with no discharge to the environment. The TMA was designed for 'nodischarge' under this condition.\n\nThe TMA cells have sufficient freeboard to safely pass the runoff resulting from the inflow design flood through the emergency spillway. The inflow design flood is the 24 -hour probable maximum flood event. The discharge from the spillway is directed towards the watershed of East Lake which flows into the Detour River system and north to Hudson Bay.\n\nThe proactive management of water issues included incorporating prevention measures into the design of the TMA. The following strategies have been adopted to reduce the risk of contaminants entering the local groundwater or surface water regimes:\n\n- The milling includes a final process step to destroy cyanide to very low levels in the tailings before it is pumped to the TMA;\n- TMA seepage collection ditches and ponds have been constructed at the base of Cell 1 \\& Cell 2 with pumps installed to recycle the water back to the TMA.\n\nWhen required, water collected from the mine site (that has not been in contact with processed reagents) is collected in the mine water pond for discharge to the Sunday Creek to prevent the accumulation of water above target operating levels. In 2023, the discharge location was transferred from East Creek to Sunday Creek following regulatory approval.\n\nThe mine water pond will continue to operate in the current location until the Cell 4 is constructed. Following the Cell 4 construction, the mine water pond will be located to the North Pit. The mine water pond will incorporate water treatment facilities to allow discharge of excess water to Sunday Creek.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.18.5 Permitting Considerations\n\n## Current Status\n\nMining projects in Canada may be subject to federal and/or provincial environmental assessment (EA) processes, governed Provincially or Federally. The federal environmental assessment process for Canadian mines is administered through the Impact Assessment Act, which replaced the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The federal environmental assessment process was triggered for the Detour Lake project due to:\n\n- The requirement for an Explosives Factory License under the Explosives Act for a project-dedicated explosives manufacturing factory;\n- The need for one or more Authorization(s) for Harmful Alteration Disruption or Destruction of Fish Habitat according to the Fisheries Act.\n\nThese licences/authorizations were granted prior to development. Agnico Eagle has engaged with the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada to confirm whether an additional federal Impact Assessment may be required for future expansions of the operating area, to date no additional development has triggered the federal Impact Assessment Act process.\n\nFive provincial EAs were approved for the Detour Lake project:\n\n- July 2010: Ontario Ministry of Environment Class EA for Electricity Projects, for the diesel power generation required to support the construction phase (AMEC, 2010a);\n- November 2010: Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources Class EA for Resource Stewardship and Facility Development Projects, for the construction of facilities offlease, and for such aspects as on-lease aggregate operations or in-water works (AMEC, 2010c);\n- December 2010: Ontario Individual EA for Electricity Projects, for construction of a 230 kV transmission line (AMEC, 2010b);\n- March 2012: Ontario Ministry of Environment Individual EA for Electricity Projects of 10 MW , for allowing a diesel-generated contingency power supply to service the construction needs should the powerline not be operable by the third quarter of 2011. With the successful energizing of the powerline in October 2011, these facilities were not installed.\n- March 2021: Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, Mine, Natural Resources, and Forestry Class C Environmental Assessment pursuant to the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act for the West Detour Project.\n\nIn accordance with Section 143(2) of the Mining Act, R.S.O. 1990, a Closure Plan for Detour Lake Mine was submitted to the Ontario government in 2010, followed by updated Closure Plan Amendments in 2014, 2019, and 2021. The most recent amendment, Closure Plan Amendment 3 (CPA3), which captures the proposed development related to the West Detour Project, was filed with the Ontario Ministry of Mines in November 2022. Subsequent amendments will be required to capture material changes associated with any future minedevelopment not captured in the project description presented in CPA3 (i.e., underground production, new facilities and disturbances associated with the updated LOM plan, such as the addition of a fourth tailings cell). A subsequent closure amendment to capture these changes is currently in the development phase, with anticipated filing in early 2026.\nOther permits, such as Permits to Take Water and Environmental Compliance Approvals, have been approved, renewed, and/or amended as needed.\n\nTable 24-15 lists additional environmental approvals, or amendments to existing approvals, which may be required in order to support ongoing development and open pit operations of the Detour Lake Mine. If applicable, any additional permitting requirements subject to approval for future mine development will be obtained prior to commencement of construction.\n\n# Permitting Requirements in Support of 2024 PEA \n\nPermitting for the underground operations is planned to be completed in two separate phases for advanced exploration and production. Accelerating the permitting for preliminary development will allow the development of the services portal and ramp to commence while the associated economic and technical studies are completed for full production. Table 24-16 shows the proposed permitting schedule.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.18.6 Social And Community Impact Considerations\n\nNo additional impacts arising from the 2024 PEA are expected and it is expected that activities occurring with the current mining operations will apply to the 2024 PEA.\n\nDetour Lake Mine continues to have a positive socio-economic impact on local communities. As of 2024, the permanent workforce totaled approximately 1,443 employees. Detour Lake Mine also creates local and provincial business opportunities.\n\n## Consultation Principles\n\nAgnico Eagle has undertaken ongoing consultation with the public, government regulators and its Indigenous partners regarding the operations, environmental commitments, and planned activities. Agnico Eagle has established the following consultation principles:\n\n- Early notification: information about the project will be provided to stakeholders in a timely manner to facilitate the stakeholder engagement process;\n- Open communication: all pertinent information about the project will be shared with stakeholders. Stakeholder input will be sought, documented, and will be addressed in the project. If input is not addressed, a reason will be provided;\n- Accessible information: a variety of stakeholder engagement methods will be used that are written in plain language to distribute information about the project and to gather stakeholder feedback;Table 24-15: List of Main Environmental Approvals Potentially Required for Current Operations\n\n| Permit/Approval | Agency Responsible | Description |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Provincial |  |  |\n| Permit to Take Water Ontario Water Resources Act | MECP | Taking of water of $>50,000 \\mathrm{~L} / \\mathrm{d}$ (mine dewatering and development) |\n| Environmental Compliance Amendment Environmental Protection Act | MECP | Amendment to the existing DLM approvals (air and noise; industrial sewage works) |\n| Work Permit Public Lands Act / Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act | MNRF | Work/construction on Crown land, including work below the high-water mark of local watercourses and construction of dams if needed |\n| Land Use Permit Public Lands Act | MNRF | Establish of tenure for facilities constructed on Crown land (pipeline and associated infrastructure/facilities) |\n| Forest Resource License (Cutting Permit) Crown Forest Sustainability Act | MNRF | Clearing of Crown merchantable timber (if any) |\n| Endangered Species Act Permit Endangered Species Act | MECP | Management of activities related to species-at-risk for Woodland Caribou |\n| Closure Plan Amendment Mining Act | MINES | For mine development, production, and eventual decommissioning of the West Detour project |\n| Provincial Class Environmental Assessment (Class A, B, or C) Mining Act | MNRF | For mine development |\n| Provincial Environmental Assessment Act (Waste Management Projects) | MECP | For landfill expansion to support on-site domestic waste disposal |\n| Federal |  |  |\n| Impact Assessment Impact Assessment Act | ECCC | For mine development |\n| Authorization(s) for Serious Harm to Fish Fisheries Act | DFO | For the establishment of the: mine rock stockpile(s); watercourse diversions / rerouting; and/or mine dewatering groundwater effects that would cause disruption to watercourses supporting fisheries |\n| Listing on Schedule 2 of Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations (MDMER) to authorize deposition of a deleterious substance in a water frequented by fish Fisheries Act | ECCC | For the establishment of mine rock stockpile(s) over waters frequented by fish |\n| Approval for Work in Navigable Water Navigable Waters Act | TC | For development over certain watercourses |\n\nNotes: ECCC = Environment and Climate Change Canada; MNRF = Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry; MECP = Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks; MINES = Ontario Ministry of Mines; DFO = Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans; TC = Transport Canada.Table 24-16: Anticipated Permitting Schedule for Proposed Underground Project\n\n| Permit/Approval | Agency | Description | Consultation | Target <br> Permit <br> Approval |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Preliminary Development |  |  |  |  |\n| Scoped closure plan amendment (CPA3.4) | MINES | Development of infrastructure related to preliminary underground mine advanced exploration | 2023 Q3-2024 Q1 | 2024 Q3 |\n| Permit to take water | MECP | De-watering groundwater from underground mine during the first 2 years of construction | 2024 Q3 | 2024 Q4 |\n| Production |  |  |  |  |\n| Permit to take water | MECP | De-watering groundwater from underground mine throughout production | 2025 Q1 | 2025 Q4 |\n| Environmental Compliance approval amendment industrial sewage | MECP | Amendment to existing Environmental Compliance Approval to account for the addition of underground dewatering infrastructure and water quality and quantity | 2025 Q2 | 2026 Q3 |\n| Environmental Compliance <br> Approval - Air | MECP | Amendment to existing Environmental Compliance Approval to account for emissions from underground mine (exploration and production), consolidated pit and West Detour Project | 2024 Q2 | 2025 Q3 |\n| Closure Plan Amendment 4 | MINES | Closure Plan Amendment to include consolidated pit, changes to TMA Cell 3, and underground production | 2024 Q4-2025 Q1 | 2026 Q2 |\n\nNote: MINES = Ontario Ministry of Mines ; MECP = Ontario Ministry of Environment\n\n- Flexible process: feedback on the stakeholder engagement process will be sought from interested individuals and stakeholders to ensure that meaningful opportunities for input are provided. Changes will be made to the public and stakeholder participation program as necessary to reflect stakeholder needs;\n- Capacity building: where acceptable and appropriate to all parties involved, community liaisons and working committees will be worked with to facilitate information exchange;\n- Mutual respect: respect will be given to the differing values and constraints of each party and to project timelines. There will be follow-through on commitments made.These principles continue to guide interactions within mine permitting, operations, and exploration.\n\nFuture environmental approval applications will provide additional detail regarding the engineering design of proposed project facilities, potential effects, and proposed mitigations measures. No changes were expected to the approvals list at the Report effective date.\n\n# Indigenous Communities \n\nAgnico Eagle has agreements with several First Nation and Métis communities who have treaty and Indigenous rights asserted within the operations area of Detour Lake Mine. These agreements provides a framework for strengthened collaboration in the development and operations of the mine and outlines tangible benefits for the Indigenous communities, including direct financial support, skills training and employment, opportunities for business development and contracting, and a framework for issues resolution, regulatory permitting and Agnico Eagle's future financial contributions. In addition, Agnico Eagle consults Indigenous communities in connection with permitting applications and ongoing projects.\nAs of March 2024, Detour Lake Mine has 151 employees from its partnered Indigenous communities and 115 self-identified Indigenous employees from other First Nations and Métis communities, representing 18\\% of the workforce. In comparison, the Ontario mining industry average for percentage of Indigenous employees in 2020 was 11.2\\%.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.18.7 Closure And Reclamation Planning\n\n## Current Operations\n\nAgnico Eagle acknowledges that the company will be responsible for providing the full amount of the financial assurance for the closure and rehabilitation of Detour Lake Mine, subject to any required or approved changes to the Closure Plan.\n\nOver the LOM, there will be developmental phases (e.g., the construction and initiation of deposition into a new tailings cell) that trigger the issuance of additional security bonding for the operation. Financial assurance is submitted to the MINES prior to the beginning of the associated activities of each phase, or as otherwise arranged with the MINES.\n\nBased on Detour Lake Mine's current phase of development, security provided to MINES to date totals approximately $\\$ 232$ million. As per the Detour Lake Mine Closure Plan Amendment 3, the total estimated closure cost for the existing Detour Lake Mine at peak development (i.e., all facilities constructed) is approximately $\\$ 256$ million, exclusive of proposed expansions such as a fourth Tailings Cell). Financial assurance associated with proposed expansions will be formalized through subsequent Closure Plan Amendments.\n\n## 2024 PEA\n\nThe 2024 PEA assumes that all waste rock and tailings will be managed using existing facilities, and therefore will follow the existing closure plan with respect to waste rock and tailings infrastructure.The 2024 PEA assumes that the total closure cost (preliminary development and production) will be $\\$ 40 \\mathrm{M}$ based on the costing of a similar project. Closure costs will be estimated with greater accuracy in the next study phase.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.19 Capital And Operating Costs\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.19.1 2024 Pea Capital Cost Estimate\n\n## Basis of Estimate\n\nCost estimates were prepared by Agnico Eagle staff.\nThe overall capital cost estimate developed in the 2024 PEA meets the AACE International Class 4 requirement and has an accuracy range of $-25 \\%$ to $+40 \\%$. Some items have a higher level of engineering and accuracy. Certain items, including but not limited to, sales taxes, permitting, feasibility studies and financing costs are excluded from the cost estimate.\n\nThe capital cost estimate includes the initial and sustaining capital costs for the underground project from 2024 to the end of underground mining operation in 2044. It excludes capital expenditures for the mill optimization to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$, and adjustments resulting from the integration with the open pit operation. The estimate base date is Q2 2024, with costs estimated in 2023 inflated by $3 \\%$ to bring them to 2024 dollars. No inflation value was attributed to the 2024 PEA project past the estimate base date.\n\nHarmonized sales tax (HST) was excluded from the estimate and no salvage value was included.\n\nAn exchange rate assumption of $1.30 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$$ was used for capital cost estimation.\nCosts were divided between initial and sustaining capital costs, which included direct and indirect costs, Owner's costs, contingency, mining development, and sustaining costs.\n\nTo integrate the 2024 PEA with the existing open pit operation, adjustments to the standalone model were required:\n\n- Development capital to optimize the mill throughput to $19 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$;\n- Sustaining capital to extend mine life from 2052-2054 based on the unit cost in stockpile re-handle years;\n- Removal of stand-alone tailings storage costs throughout mine plan via the assumption of in-pit filling for incremental tonnes from the 2024 PEA in 2053-2054.\n\n\n## Estimate Approach\n\nThe capital cost estimate was developed differently depending on the type of cost and/or discipline evaluated. The following subsections provide a brief summary of how the estimate was produced.# Earthworks \n\nThe earthwork quantities were estimated from drawings, topographical data, and geotechnical information. Excavation and backfill volumes were based on 3D models using CAD software.\n\nExcess excavated overburden will be sent to the existing overburden pile or reused within the required infrastructure if the material is considered suitable.\n\nExcess excavated rock will be sent to the appropriate waste rock storage facility or reused within the required infrastructures if it is deemed suitable.\n\nThe required granular material will be sourced as free issue from the existing waste rock, and crushed/screened to the required size by a contractor.\n\nThe unit rates for earthworks were priced with unit rates obtained from recent Detour Lake Mine projects.\n\n## Concrete\n\nConcrete quantities were based on general arrangement drawings and typical foundation details.\n\nReady-mix concrete will be supplied by the existing on-site contractor and batch plant. Supply rates from the contractor's 2023 price book were used within the estimate.\n\nThe concrete installation price was estimated using database prices, separated by foundation type.\n\n## Structural Steel\n\nThe structural steel quantities were either based on consultants and/or supplier material take-offs or on historical data for infrastructure of a similar nature. Quantities included the structural steel required for buildings as well as equipment supports, steel decks, grating, handrails, stairs, ladders, etc.\n\nStructural steel supply price and installation were based on database pricing, grouped by component type.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe architectural component quantities were based on general arrangement drawings and typical details. They included all the components required for buildings other than structural steel, such as cladding, insulation, garage doors, man doors, canopies, windows, partition walls, etc.\n\nArchitectural component pricing was based on database pricing, grouped by component type.# Platework \n\nThe platework quantities were based on consultants and/or supplier material take-offs or on historical data for infrastructure of a similar nature. They included such infrastructure as steel tanks and bins, pump boxes, liners, chutes, etc.\n\nPlatework pricing was based on database pricing.\n\n## Mechanical\n\nThe mechanical supply and installation prices were based on recent quotes, historical quotes of a similar nature and database pricing. Once the mechanical pricing was estimated, other disciplines were priced according to the estimated historical ratios for mechanical equipment.\n\n## Piping\n\nThe piping costs were estimated in two ways:\n\n- All exterior pipeline quantities used to service various infrastructure were estimated using the general arrangement drawings and target infrastructure locations. Supply and installation of the pipelines were based on recent quotes, historical quotes of a similar nature, or database pricing;\n- All interior piping was estimated using mechanical equipment ratios based on projects of a similar nature.\n\n\n## Electrical and Instrumentation\n\nThe electrical and instrumentation costs were estimated in two ways:\n\n- All exterior power line and substation quantities used to service various infrastructure were estimated using the general arrangement drawings and target infrastructure locations. Supply and installation of these power lines and substations were based on recent quotes, historical quotes of a similar nature, or database pricing;\n- All interior electrical and instrumentation was estimated using mechanical equipment ratios based on projects of a similar nature.\n\n\n## Indirect Cost\n\nThe indirect costs include items that were necessary for the completion of the 2024 PEA, but which were not part of the direct costs. These costs were developed as a combination of high-level calculations based on the construction schedule and project requirements, supplemented with Agnico Eagle's project benchmarks.\n\nUnderground infrastructure construction requires less indirect costs because some of these costs are calculated inside the Owner's cost prior to production. As the mine develops during production, subsequent underground infrastructure will be constructed with the aid of the current operational management team and the equipment in place.Indirect costs are not applicable to all the types of costs. The following lists the types of cost to which indirects were not applied:\n\n- Purchase of mobile equipment;\n- Tailings impoundment costs;\n- Owner's cost;\n- Mining activities (development).\n\n\n# Contingency \n\nThe contingency estimated for the 2024 PEA was a specific amount of money that was set aside in case any unforeseen or extra costs arise during the construction process, such as:\n\n- \"Known unknowns\";\n- Unforeseen expenses;\n- Omissions or errors in project documentation;\n- Insurance against changes in scheduling and pricing.\n\nThe contingency for the 2024 PEA was adjusted by the level of engineering completed by area. It was evaluated as a percentage of the directs costs ranging from 10-40\\%.\n\nContingency was not applied to all the types of costs. The following lists the types of cost to which no contingency was applied:\n\n- Tailings impoundment costs;\n- Owner's cost;\n- Mining activities (development);\n\n\n## Workforce\n\nTwo work schedules were used for the 2024 PEA, based on the current Detour Lake Mine surface operation:\n\n- A 14/14 schedule entails 14 days on-site followed by 14 days off, and is the schedule for the hourly staff, with the workday split into two 12-hour shifts. A significant proportion of the salaried staff will also be on this schedule, which applies to all jobs for which a full-time presence is required on-site;\n- A 4/3 schedule, which features 4 days on-site and 3 days off, applies to the salaried staff who do not work cross-shifts.\n\nThe total workforce required for the 2024 PEA is shown in Figure 24-15.Figure 24-15:2024 PEA Workforce Requirements\n![img-71.jpeg](img-71.jpeg)\n\nNote: Figure prepared by Agnico Eagle, 2024.\n\n# Capital Cost Summary \n\nThe capital cost estimate by key area is provided in Table 24-17.\nCapital costs broken out into initial or sustaining capital cost estimates are provided in Table 24-18. The total initial capital cost totals C\\$964.3 M, the sustaining capital estimate is C\\$993.2 M, and closure costs are C\\$40 M. The total estimated capital cost for the 2024 PEA is C\\$1,997.5 M.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.19.1 2024 Pea Operating Cost Estimate\n\n## Basis of Estimate\n\nThe 2024 PEA operating cost estimate includes operating costs for the underground project as a standalone scenario, and excludes adjustments related to the integration with the open pit operation. The estimate was derived based on comparable active Agnico Eagle operations in the Abitibi region (i.e., Goldex, LaRonde, and LZ5). Salaries were based on the Detour Lake Mine operation salary for staff employees and on Macassa for underground hourly rates. In addition, a detailed mining plan, mining physicals, a staffing list, an electrical load list, a fuel consumption evaluation and an underground ventilation evaluation were prepared to provide more details for the operating cost estimates. The underground project will support the G\\&A cost. Some additional assumptions were made to reflect specific costs related to the Detour Lake Mine site or activities.\n\nA portion of the initial operating costs incurred during pre-production were not included in the operating costs, and were transferred to the capital expenditures.Table 24-17: 2024 PEA Capital Cost Estimate by Area\n\n| Main Area | Initial <br> (C\\$M) | Sustaining <br> (C\\$M) | Total <br> (C\\$M) | Total <br> (\\%) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Mining development | 214.9 | 586.3 | 801.2 | 40.1 |\n| Underground mine | 272.5 | 231.6 | 504.1 | 25.2 |\n| Surface facilities | 187.6 | 0.2 | 187.8 | 9.4 |\n| Environment | 18.8 | 161.2 | 180.0 | 9.0 |\n| Owner's cost | 160.5 | 0.0 | 160.5 | 8.0 |\n| Process plant | 108.9 | 10.4 | 119.3 | 6.0 |\n| Closure | 0.0 | 40.0 | 40.0 | 2.0 |\n| Offsite infrastructure | 1.2 | 3.5 | 4.6 | 0.2 |\n| Total | $\\mathbf{9 6 4 . 3}$ | $\\mathbf{1 , 0 3 3 . 2}$ | $\\mathbf{1 , 9 9 7 . 5}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0}$ |\n\nTable 24-18: 2024 PEA Capital Cost Estimate by Initial/Sustaining\n\n| Initial/Sustaining | Estimate Area | Total <br> (C\\$M) | Total <br> (\\%) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n|  | Direct | 433.5 | 21.7 |\n| Initial capital cost estimate | Direct contingency | 70.0 | 3.5 |\n|  | Indirect | 85.5 | 4.3 |\n|  | Indirect contingency | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n|  | Mining development | 214.9 | 10.8 |\n|  | Owner's cost | 160.5 | 8.0 |\n|  | Sub-total | 964.3 | 48.3 |\n|  | Direct | 371.7 | 18.6 |\n|  | Direct contingency | 22.2 | 1.1 |\n|  | Indirect | 12.9 | 0.6 |\n|  | Indirect contingency | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n|  | Mining development | 586.3 | 29.4 |\n|  | Sub-total | 993.2 | 49.7 |\n|  | Closure | 40.0 | 2.0 |\n| Total |  | $\\mathbf{1 , 9 9 7 . 5}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0}$ |To integrate the Detour Lake Underground project with the existing open pit operation, adjustments to the stand-alone model were required:\n\n- Addition of stockpile re-handling cost based on open pit unit costs in 2047-2051;\n- Replacement of the processing costs (excluding paste plant) in 2030-2044 by processing costs in 2052-2054 based on open pit unit costs in 2047-2051;\n- Adjustment of royalties in 2044 reflecting production changes;\n- Addition of G\\&A costs for additional years of operation in 2052-2054 based on open pit unit costs in 2047-2051.\n\n\n# Operating Cost Summary \n\nThe estimated operating costs are provided in Table 24-19. Operating cost forecasts total $\\$ 3.5$ billion, averaging $\\$ 65.45 /$ of mineralized material processed.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.20 Economic Analysis\n\nThe 2024 PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.\n\nSet out in the remainder of this sub-section are the basis for the 2024 PEA as well as the qualifications and assumptions made by the QP.\n\nThe 2024 PEA has no impact on the Mineral Reserves discussed in Sections 15-22.\nThe financial analysis of the underground project was prepared as the difference between a base case scenario (\"Open Pit\", described in Section 21) with process plant production at $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ and a scenario with additional production from underground starting in 2030, and a ramp-up in process plant production to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ by 2028 (\"Open Pit + Underground + Mill Optimization\", described in this sub-section). The difference between these two scenarios represents the differential value of underground and the Mill Expansion (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\", also described in this sub-section). The different financial models are summarized in Table 24-20.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.20.1 Methodology\n\nThe project was valued using a discounted free cash flow approach. Estimates were prepared for all the individual elements of cash revenue and cash expenditures for ongoing operations. Free cash flow is assumed to occur in the middle of each period. The net present value was calculated as at 1 April, 2024.AGNICO EAGLE\n\nTable 24-19: 2024 PEA Operating Cost Estimate\n\n| Category | LOM Unit Cost <br> (\\$/t milled) | LOM Total Cost <br> (\\$M) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Underground geology | 0.94 | 49.90 |\n| Underground development | 3.84 | 202.82 |\n| Underground production | 13.27 | 701.45 |\n| Underground maintenance | 11.40 | 602.20 |\n| Underground services | 10.72 | 566.56 |\n| Mill production | 10.82 | 571.78 |\n| Mill service | 1.13 | 59.65 |\n| Mill maintenance | - | - |\n| Site administration | 5.96 | 315.11 |\n| Site services | 7.04 | 372.02 |\n| Site services maintenance | 0.32 | 16.99 |\n| Total | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 4 5}$ | $\\mathbf{3 , 4 5 8 . 4 8}$ |\n\nTable 24-20: Summary of Financial Models Included In Report\n\n| Model Description | Short Form Description | Report <br> Section |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Base case scenario | \"Open Pit\" | 21 |\n| Integrated open pit, underground, and <br> mill optimization | \"Open Pit + Underground + Mill Expansion\" | 24.20 |\n| Differential value of underground and <br> mill optimization | \"Underground + Mill Expansion\" <br> (equal to \"Open Pit + Underground + Mill <br> Optimization\" minus \"Open Pit\") | 24.20 |\n\nFinancial analysis of the underground project was prepared as the difference between a base case scenario with process plant production at $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ and a scenario with additional production from underground starting in 2030, and a ramp-up in process plant production to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ by 2028. As mill feed from the underground project is at higher grade than the ore from the open pit, incremental mill feed from underground mineralization is matched with an offsetting decrease of open pit ore milling, re-captured at the end of the plan.\n\nIn addition to the operating and capital costs associated with the underground project, adjustments were made to reflect incremental spending at the end of the plan to process re-captured tonnes at the end of the plan. These adjustments include fixed and variable processing costs, mine re-handling costs, general and administrative costs, as well as sustaining capital in line with a stockpile re-handling period.This sub-section includes references to non-International Financial Reporting Standards Performance measures as outlined in the Cautionary Note on Non-International Financial Reporting Standards Financial Performance Measures, these include:\n\n- Free cash flow;\n- Total cash cost per ounce;\n- Minesite cost per tonne;\n- Sustaining capital;\n- Development capital.\n\nA discount rate of $5 \\%$ was assumed based on integration of the project in a mine site with existing process and infrastructure facilities with more than 10 years of commercial production in a stable low-risk jurisdiction.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.20.2 Input Parameters\n\n## Mineral Resources within 2024 PEA Mine Plan\n\nThe proposed underground production will span 15 years, following seven years of initial capital investment.\n\nWith the addition of the underground mine envisaged in the 2024 PEA, offset by higher process plant production, milling at the Detour Lake Operations would extend by one year (from 2053 to 2054).\n\nThe financial model includes an additional year (2055) to account for discounted closure costs extending through to the end of the closure period.\n\n## Metallurgical Recoveries\n\nThe metallurgical recovery assumptions and basis for recoveries for the open pit operation were provided in Section 13.4, and for the mineral resources potentially amenable to underground operations in Section 13.5.\n\nRecovery will vary based on gold grade, and will average $92.2 \\%$ in the integrated scenario.\n\n## Metal Prices and Exchange Rates\n\nThe gold price assumption used in the economic analysis is US\\$1,900/oz Au at an exchange rate of $1.34 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$$. Gold price and exchange rate assumptions were determined corporately by Agnico Eagle.\n\nThe gold price assumption was more conservative than the London Metal Exchange closing spot price on August 26, 2024 gold price which is US\\$2,511/oz Au. The assumption was in line with the London Bullion Market Association average monthly gold price for the past three years, which was US\\$1,900/oz Au for the period June 2021 to May 2024.# Gross Gold Revenue \n\nGross gold revenue consisted of inflows from the sale of gold before any refining, transport, marketing, and royalties. Sales related to in-kind royalties were excluded from gross gold revenue.\n\n## Transport, Refining, and Marketing Charges\n\nDoré transport and refining charges were based on existing agreements and fluctuate based on number of gold shipments, shipment volume, and gold content.\n\nMarketing costs were based on Agnico Eagle's corporate unit cost allocation for current operations.\n\n## Net Gold Revenue\n\nNet gold revenue was gross revenue after transport, refining, and marketing charges.\n\n## Capital and Operating Costs\n\nThe capital and operating cost estimates for the existing open pit operation were included in Section 21, while those for the 2024 PEA were included in Section 24.19.\n\nMine operating costs were presented with an adjustment for deferred stripping.\n\n## Royalties\n\nRoyalties included in the economic analysis are:\n\n- Franco-Nevada: 2\\% net smelter return (in-kind royalty);\n- Other royalties.\n\n\n## Working Capital\n\nChanges in working capital include:\n\n- Change in inventories of mill feed stockpiles, gold-in-circuit, and doré (changes in inventory above operating margin);\n- Changes in accounts payables, accounts receivables, supplies inventory, and prepaid expenses related to the maintenance and repair contract for 795 haul trucks.\n\nThe economic model assumes four days for accounts receivables, 51 days for accounts payable, and 33 days of supply inventory. These assumptions are based on recent operating history.\n\nChanges in working capital in the initial stages of the mine life reflect accumulation of mill feed stockpiles. Depletion of these stockpiles starts in 2044 with termination of ex-pit mining. Gold-in-circuit and doré inventory are depleted and sold in the last year of production.# Taxes \n\nTaxes included in the economic evaluation are the Federal income tax (15\\%), provincial income tax (10\\%), and the Ontario mining tax (10\\%). Depreciation schedules based on current depreciable balances and yearly capital additions were used to model tax depreciation for processing and transportation assets as well as mining assets.\n\nThe undiscounted effective tax rate (as \\% of free cash flow before tax) was $28.7 \\%$ for the integrated scenario and $33.0 \\%$ for the differential value of underground and mill expansion.\n\nThe tax model was completed at the project level, which has the Detour Lake Mine as a stand-alone operating asset.\n\n## Closure Costs and Salvage Value\n\nClosure costs were based on reclamation schedules extending through three next centuries after the end of operations. Progressive reclamation will occur throughout the operating period. Reclamation activities were broken down into active closure, passive closure/flooding of the mine pit, final closure/ active discharge, and post closure/passive discharge. Costs extending beyond the operating period were discounted back to the year following the last year of production at the selected discount rate and included in that year.\n\nNo salvage value of assets was factored into the economic model.\n\n## Lease Payments\n\nLease payments reflect payments associated with Right of Use Assets recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 16.\n\n## Financing\n\nThe base case economic analysis assumed 100\\% equity financing and was reported on a $100 \\%$ project ownership basis.\n\n## Inflation\n\nThe base case economic analysis assumed constant prices with no inflationary adjustments. Capital and operating costs were expressed in 2024 Canadian dollars.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.20.3 Economic Analysis, Integrated Open Pit, Underground, And Mill Optimization Model\n\nTable 24-21, Table 24-22, and Table 24-23 provide a summary of the discounted free cash flow analysis for the Detour Lake Mine with the integration of the underground mine and mill optimization to existing operations.\n\nFree cash flows in years 2027-2028 are lower due to a combination of lower gold grades due to the mining position, concurrent construction of TMA Cells 2 and 3, as well as capital costs associated with the underground mine.Table 24-21: Cash Flow Analysis of Detour Lake Operations By Integrating Underground Mine and Mill Optimization Of Existing Detour Lake Operations (2024 Q2-2036)\n\n| Parameter | $\\begin{aligned} & 2024 \\\\ & \\text { (Q2-Q4) } \\end{aligned}$ | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 2032 | 2033 | 2034 | 2035 | 2036 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Mining Physicals (Open Pit) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mineralization mined (Mt) | 31.4 | 30.2 | 30.8 | 25.7 | 38.3 | 43.4 | 54.2 | 44.9 | 47.4 | 45.3 | 42.4 | 41.8 | 40.2 |\n| Waste mined (Mt) | 53.7 | 107.7 | 105.1 | 107.4 | 95.8 | 90.6 | 77.1 | 80.5 | 70.8 | 72.0 | 63.2 | 64.7 | 59.1 |\n| Ex-pit mined (Mt) | 85.1 | 137.9 | 135.9 | 133.0 | 134.1 | 134.0 | 131.3 | 125.4 | 118.2 | 117.2 | 105.6 | 106.5 | 99.3 |\n| Strip ratio (waste/ore) | 1.71 | 3.57 | 3.41 | 4.18 | 2.50 | 2.09 | 1.42 | 1.79 | 1.49 | 1.59 | 1.49 | 1.55 | 1.47 |\n| Ex-pit metal content (koz) | 696 | 818 | 827 | 614 | 823 | 997 | 1,392 | 1,221 | 1,283 | 1,169 | 1,110 | 1,024 | 991 |\n| Ex-pit mineralization grade ( $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ ) | 0.69 | 0.84 | 0.83 | 0.74 | 0.67 | 0.71 | 0.80 | 0.85 | 0.84 | 0.80 | 0.81 | 0.76 | 0.77 |\n| Mining Physicals (Underground) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mineralization mined (Mt) | — | — | — | — | — | — | 0.8 | 2.8 | 3.6 | 4.0 | 4.0 | 4.1 | 4.1 |\n| Mineralization metal content (koz) | — | — | — | — | — | — | 91 | 261 | 293 | 323 | 342 | 337 | 326 |\n| Ex-pit mineralization grade ( $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ ) | — | — | — | — | — | — | 3.68 | 2.89 | 2.52 | 2.49 | 2.63 | 2.56 | 2.48 |\n| Processing Physicals |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Milled (Mt) | 21.0 | 28.2 | 28.5 | 28.7 | 29.0 | 29.0 | 29.0 | 29.0 | 29.0 | 29.0 | 29.0 | 29.0 | 29.0 |\n| Head grade ( $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{t}$ ) | 0.88 | 0.88 | 0.89 | 0.76 | 0.77 | 0.88 | 1.17 | 1.30 | 1.32 | 1.30 | 1.30 | 1.22 | 1.20 |\n| Feed metal content (koz) | 590 | 796 | 815 | 699 | 719 | 816 | 1,092 | 1,207 | 1,232 | 1,210 | 1,215 | 1,136 | 1,117 |\n| Recovery (\\%) | 91.6 | 92.3 | 92.1 | 91.6 | 91.5 | 91.8 | 92.9 | 93.3 | 93.5 | 93.4 | 93.4 | 93.1 | 93.1 |\n| Gold recovered (koz) | 540 | 735 | 751 | 640 | 658 | 749 | 1,015 | 1,127 | 1,151 | 1,130 | 1,135 | 1,058 | 1,040 |\n| Gold poured (koz) | 540 | 735 | 751 | 640 | 658 | 749 | 1,015 | 1,127 | 1,151 | 1,130 | 1,135 | 1,058 | 1,040 |\n| Sales |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gold price (C\\$/oz) | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 |\n| Gold sold (koz) | 529 | 720 | 736 | 628 | 645 | 734 | 995 | 1,104 | 1,128 | 1,108 | 1,112 | 1,036 | 1,020 |\n| Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (C\\$M) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gross gold revenues | 1,348 | 1,834 | 1,874 | 1,598 | 1,641 | 1,869 | 2,533 | 2,811 | 2,872 | 2,821 | 2,831 | 2,639 | 2,596 |\n| Transp., marketing, and ref' charges | (3) | (4) | (4) | (4) | (4) | (4) | (6) | (6) | (7) | (6) | (6) | (6) | (6) || Parameter | $\\begin{aligned} & 2024 \\\\ & \\text { (Q2-Q4) } \\end{aligned}$ | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 2032 | 2033 | 2034 | 2035 | 2036 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Net gold revenues | 1,345 | 1,830 | 1,869 | 1,594 | 1,638 | 1,865 | 2,527 | 2,805 | 2,865 | 2,814 | 2,825 | 2,633 | 2,590 |\n| Site operating costs -

While changes in inventory impacts these metrics negatively during stockpile reclaim, the operation still generates positive free cash flow throughout the period.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.20.4 Economic Analysis Of Differential Value Of Underground And Mill Optimization (\"Underground\") Model\n\nTable 24-24, Table 24-25, and Table 24-26 present a summary of the discounted cash flow analysis of the differential value of adding the underground mine and mill optimization on the base scenario where processing production plateaus at $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\" model).\n\nThe cumulative free cash flow before tax is estimated at C\\$4,552 M. The cumulative free cash flow after tax is C\\$3,052 M.\n\nAt a 5\\% discount rate, the net present value of free cash flows before tax is C\\$1,971 M and of free cash flow after tax is C\\$1,187 M. The internal rate of return of the 2024 PEA is $18.3 \\%$ with an 11-year payback period.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.20.5 Sensitivity Analysis Of \"Underground + Mill Optimization\" Model\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the differential value of underground and mill optimization (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\") was performed considering variations in gold price, exchange rate, operating and capital costs. Flexing based on gold grade processed was excluded because it reflects the same sensitivity as the gold price, given a flat gold price assumption.\n\nResults are shown in Figure 24-16 (net present value after tax at 5\\% discount rate) and Figure 24-17 (internal rate of return).\n\nSensitivity of the Project to changes in gold price and exchange rate are shown in Table 24-27 (net present value) and Table 24-28 (internal rate of return).\n\nThe Project has positive after tax net present value under the Project Assumptions (US\\$1,900/oz and 1.34 C\\$/US\\$). Addition of the underground has a positive after tax net present value using the assumptions supporting Mineral Reserve estimation (US\\$1,400/oz and $1.30 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$)$.Table 24-24: Cash Flow Analysis of Differential Value Of Adding Underground Mine And Mill Optimization To Existing Detour Lake Operations (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\") (2024 Q2-2036)\n\n| Parameters | $\\begin{aligned} & 2024 \\\\ & \\text { (Q2-Q4) } \\end{aligned}$ | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 2032 | 2033 | 2034 | 2035 | 2036 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Mining Physicals (Underground) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mineralization mined (Mt) | — | — | — | — | — | — | 0.8 | 2.8 | 3.6 | 4.0 | 4.0 | 4.1 | 4.1 |\n| Mineralization metal content (koz) | — | — | — | — | — | — | 91 | 261 | 293 | 323 | 342 | 337 | 326 |\n| Ex-pit mineralization grade (g/t) | — | — | — | — | — | — | 3.68 | 2.89 | 2.52 | 2.49 | 2.63 | 2.56 | 2.48 |\n| Processing Physicals |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Milled (Mt) | — | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |\n| Feed metal content (koz) | — | 11 | (3) | 5 | 25 | 17 | 101 | 232 | 246 | 259 | 293 | 295 | 309 |\n| Gold recovered (koz) | — | 10 | (3) | 4 | 23 | 15 | 96 | 222 | 237 | 248 | 281 | 283 | 296 |\n| Gold poured (koz) | — | 10 | (3) | 4 | 23 | 15 | 96 | 222 | 237 | 248 | 281 | 283 | 296 |\n| Sales |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gold price (C\\$/oz) | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 | 2,546 |\n| Gold sold (koz) | — | 10 | (3) | 4 | 23 | 15 | 94 | 218 | 232 | 243 | 275 | 277 | 291 |\n| Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (C\\$M) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gross gold revenues | — | 25 | (8) | 9 | 57 | 37 | 240 | 554 | 591 | 620 | 701 | 706 | 740 |\n| Transp., marketing, and ref charges | — | (0) | 0 | (0) | (0) | (0) | (1) | (1) | (1) | (1) | (2) | (2) | (2) |\n| Net gold revenues | — | 25 | (8) | 9 | 57 | 37 | 239 | 553 | 589 | 618 | 699 | 705 | 738 |\n| Site operating costs - mining ${ }^{1}$ | — | 4 | 7 | 16 | 24 | 35 | (43) | (141) | (156) | (150) | (143) | (151) | (156) |\n| Site operating costs - processing | — | (3) | (6) | (6) | (6) | (6) | (8) | (9) | (10) | (9) | (9) | (9) | (9) |\n| Site operating costs - site admin | — | (4) | (7) | (16) | (24) | (35) | (42) | (50) | (52) | (54) | (55) | (55) | (56) |\n| Subtotal site operating costs | — | (3) | (6) | (6) | (6) | (6) | (93) | (199) | (218) | (213) | (207) | (216) | (221) |\n| Royalties | — | (0) | 0 | (0) | (0) | (0) | (2) | (5) | (5) | (5) | (6) | (6) | (6) |\n| Changes in inventory | — | (2) | (3) | (6) | (5) | (7) | 35 | 42 | 107 | 87 | 86 | 75 | 102 |\n| Operating margin | — | 20 | (18) | (3) | 46 | 24 | 179 | 391 | 473 | 487 | 573 | 559 | 613 || Parameters | $\\begin{aligned} & 2024 \\\\ & \\text { (Q2-Q4) } \\end{aligned}$ | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | 2031 | 2032 | 2033 | 2034 | 2035 | 2036 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Capital expenditures | (26) | (41) | (134) | (169) | (191) | (242) | (217) | (81) | (54) | (82) | (71) | (76) | (75) |\n| Reclamation (ARO) | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| Lease payments | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| Study costs | (5) | (3) | (1) | (1) | (1) | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| Less: share-based compensation | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n| Less: changes in working capital | — | 4 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 10 | (34) | (47) | (108) | (86) | (88) | (74) | (102) |\n| Free cash flow before taxes | (31) | (21) | (144) | (165) | (140) | (208) | (72) | 263 | 312 | 318 | 414 | 408 | 436 |\n| Tax | 10 | (3) | 18 | 15 | 16 | 30 | (9) | (78) | (110) | (120) | (152) | (151) | (171) |\n| Free cash flow after taxes | (22) | (24) | (126) | (150) | (125) | (178) | (81) | 186 | 201 | 198 | 262 | 257 | 265 |\n| Discounted free cash flow before tax | (31) | (20) | (129) | (141) | (114) | (161) | (53) | 185 | 208 | 203 | 251 | 236 | 240 |\n| Discounted free cash flow after tax | (21) | (23) | (113) | (128) | (101) | (138) | (59) | 130 | 135 | 126 | 159 | 148 | 146 |\n| Cum. disc. free cash flow after tax | (21) | (44) | (157) | (285) | (386) | (524) | (583) | (453) | (318) | (192) | (34) | 115 | 260 |\n| Cost per ounce metrics |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Total cash cost (US\\$/oz) | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |\n\nNote: 1.

The paste backfill distribution system must be designed accordingly, which is not standard practice;\n- Any changes to the Detour open pit shell, LOM schedule or deposition schedule will be impactful to the Detour UG design sequence.\n- The 2024 PEA mining plan has limited contact with the Placer Dome Old Workings. These Old Workings have been digitized and the open pit already manages the intersection of some of the old drifts. However, interacting with the Old Workings underground could prove to be more challenging in terms of water management and ground stability;- The 2024 PEA mine design relies mainly on trucking for the haulage, with a limited number of ore passes. The design does not allow for simple trucking automation solutions. There is a lot of pressure on the trucking haulage system to achieve the production targets;\n- The following geotechnical risks have been identified and should be addressed during future more detailed studies:\n- Lower recovery of crown pillar stopes between the underground and open pit depending on overall open pit / underground mine planning;\n- Uncertainty regarding the behaviour and stability of excavations (at depth and under induced stresses) in the chloritic greenstone domain;\n- Siting of critical infrastructure (vent raises, ore-waste passes, east-west development) in the chloritic greenstone domain;\n- Uncertainty regarding the in-situ stress tensor;\n- One of the major infrastructure elements in the 2024 PEA is the underground conveyor. It is a key item, as all the mineralized material is planned to be carried out of the mine via this conveyor. The conveyor ramp portal location fits very well with the location of the dome and processing plant. At the Report effective date, however, there was limited geotechnical information regarding the conveyor ramp portal.\n- No mineralized material handling is planned in the service ramp. If a delay is incurred in the conveyor ramp development or the installation of the conveyor, mineralized material handling will have to be done via the service ramp. If this happens, productivity will be greatly impacted, and the cost will increase;\n- Risk of permit delays.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 24.21.2 Opportunities\n\nOpportunities include:\n\n- Potential exists to increase the mineralization extent and grade confidence through additional core drilling. Mineralization extends along the west end of the current deposit, and parallel to the chloritic greenstone unit and the structural splays coming out of it;\n- Upgrading the Inferred confidence to higher confidence categories with additional drilling and studies;\n- During development, a significant amount of material would have sufficient grade to be sent to the Detour Lake Mine low-grade stockpiles for potential processing at the end of the proposed mine life.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 24.22 Interpretation And Conclusions\n\nUsing the assumptions and parameters detailed for the 2024 PEA, which includes Inferred Mineral Resources in the PEA mine plan, the conceptual economic analysis returns positive economics."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 25.1 Introduction\n\nThe QPs note the following interpretations and conclusions in their respective areas of expertise, based on the review of data available for this Report.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.2 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights, Royalties And Agreements\n\nInformation obtained from Agnico Eagle experts supports that the mineral tenure held is valid, and sufficient to support estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.\n\nThe surface rights are sufficient for all surface infrastructure and mine operations envisaged in the LOM plan.\n\nSurface run-off that is captured at the operations provides the process water. This water source is sufficient for the LOM plan.\n\nCertain of the claims are subject to a 2\\% royalty payable to Franco-Nevada Corporation. This royalty is included in the cash flow analysis. Prism is entitled to a $7.5 \\%$ net profit interest on the Zone 58N deposit. Other claims are subject to royalties to third parties but these claims do not fall within the area of the estimated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. Agnico Eagle has certain payments to First Nations groups in the area of the estimated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves; these payments are included in the economic analysis. The Detour Lake Operations are not subject to any other back-in rights payments, agreements, or encumbrances.\n\nTo the extent known, there are no other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the Project that have not been discussed in this Report.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.3 Geology And Mineralization\n\nThe Detour Lake and Zone 58 N deposits are considered to be examples of orogenic greenstone-hosted hydrothermal lode gold deposits.\n\nThe geological understanding of the settings, lithologies, and structural and alteration controls on mineralization in the different zones is sufficient to support estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. The geological knowledge of the area is also considered sufficiently acceptable to reliably inform mine planning.\n\nThe mineralization style and setting are well understood and can support declaration of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.\n\nExploration potential remains in the area where Mineral Resources are estimated. The Detour Lake deposit remains open at depth and to the west. Regionally, geophysicalsurveys and exploration drill holes have identified a number of gold showings and structural trends that warrant additional exploration.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.4 Exploration, Drilling And Analytical Data Collection In Support Of Mineral Resource Estimation\n\nThe exploration programs completed to date are appropriate for the style of the deposits on the Project.\n\nSampling methods are acceptable for Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.\nSample preparation, analysis and security are generally performed in accordance with exploration best practices and industry standards.\n\nThe quantity and quality of the lithological, geotechnical, collar and down-hole survey data collected during the exploration and delineation drilling programs are sufficient to support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation. The collected sample data adequately reflect deposit dimensions, true widths of mineralization, and the style of the deposits. Sampling is representative of the gold grades in the deposits, reflecting areas of higher and lower grades.\n\nThe QA/QC programs adequately address issues of precision, accuracy, and contamination. Drilling programs since 1993 typically included blanks, duplicates, and standard samples. QA/QC submission rates meet industry-accepted standards.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.5 Metallurgical Testwork\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine process plant was constructed in 2012, started operations in 2013, and has been operating since. The plant design was based on metallurgical testwork completed during Pre-Feasibility and feasibility studies, conducted from 2009-2010. Most of the metallurgical testing was completed at SGS Lakefield, with follow-up testwork (lead nitrate and oxygen control) carried out onsite by site personnel.\n\nMetallurgical testwork and associated analytical procedures were appropriate to the mineralization type, appropriate to establish processing routes, and were performed using samples that are typical of the mineralization styles found within the Project.\n\nSamples selected for testing were representative of the various types and styles of mineralization. Samples were selected from a range of depths within the deposits. Sufficient samples were taken so that tests were performed on sufficient sample mass.\n\nRecovery factors estimated are based on appropriate metallurgical testwork, and are appropriate to the mineralization types and the selected process routes. The recovery equation for the LOM is derived from 2019-2020 plant data and no changes have been done for this LOM as the model appears to not have changed. The average LOM recovery forecast is $91.6 \\%$ for the Detour Lake and North Pits.The variability of the ore in the Main Detour Pit is related to the talc, copper, and sulphur content. The talc zone is mainly located on the south end of the Main Pit while copper and sulphur are present throughout the pit in various quantities. High-talc ore are soft and will process faster. High-talc ore used to impact recovery in the past and talc ores were limited to $15 \\%$ of plant feed. It was found that recovery could be maintained with very high lead nitrate dosage rates. Processing of $40 \\%$ talc ore in feed in 2020 yielded similar recoveries as non-talc ore. Sulphur content also impacts recovery and blending strategies to avoid feeding the plant with ores over $2 \\%$ sulphur are in place and have worked successfully. Copper is an element that impact cyanide and $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ consumption. It is managed by blending if too high and by controlling slurry temperature to leach feed. To avoid the copper plating on the carbon, a control strategy on the cyanide/copper ratio is in place. The installation of a cooling tower for the reclaim water is being considered and should reduce the amount of copper being dissolved.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.6 Mineral Resource Estimates\n\nMineral Resources are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards, and assume both open pit and underground mining methods in estimation.\n\nFactors that may affect the Mineral Resource estimates include: metal price and exchange rate assumptions; changes to the assumptions used to generate the estimation domains; changes in local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of mineralized zones; changes to geological and mineralization shape and geological and grade continuity assumptions; changes in the treatment of high-grade gold values; density assignments; changes to geotechnical, mining and metallurgical recovery assumptions; changes to the input and design parameter assumptions that pertain to the assumptions for open pit and underground mining constraining the estimates; and assumptions as to the continued ability to access the site, retain mineral and surface rights titles, maintain environment and other regulatory permits, and maintain the social license to operate.\n\nThere is upside potential for the Mineral Resource estimates if mineralization that is currently classified as Inferred can be upgraded to higher-confidence Mineral Resource categories.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.7 Mineral Reserve Estimates\n\nMineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards and are based on open pit mining methods.\n\nFactors that may affect the Mineral Reserve estimates include: changes to the gold price and exchange rate assumptions; changes to pit slope and geotechnical assumptions; changes to operating cost assumptions used in the constraining pit shell; changes to pit designs from those currently envisaged; unforeseen dilution; changes to hydrogeological and pit dewatering assumptions; changes to inputs to capital and operating cost estimates; ability to permit West Detour and North Pit pits and western extent of the ultimate DetourLake pit; and changes to modifying factor assumptions, including environmental, permitting and social licence to operate.\n\nThere is upside potential for the Mineral Reserve estimates if mineralization that is currently classified as Mineral Resources potentially amenable to underground mining methods can be converted to Mineral Reserves following appropriate technical studies.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.8 Mine Plan\n\nThe current mining operations use conventional open pit mining methods and equipment.\nMining is based on a phased approach with stockpiling to bring high-grade ore forward, and provide operational flexibility.\n\nThere are a total of eight phases designed for the Detour Lake Pit and one for North Pit.\nThe mine production schedule forecasts a total 2,088 Mt to be mined over a period of 20 years (2024-2044). A total of 818 Mt of ore is planned to be milled over a period of 30 years (2024-2053); with the last nine years of production supported by long-term stockpile reclaim. The optimized and variable cut-off strategy combined with 248 Mt of stockpile capacity, results in an average LOM stripping ratio of 1.76 .\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.9 Recovery Plan\n\nThe process methods are conventional to the industry. The comminution and recovery processes are widely used in the industry with no significant elements of technological innovation.\n\nThe process plant flowsheet design was based on testwork results, previous study designs and industry standard practices.\n\nThe process facilities in use are appropriate to the mineralization styles.\nWith the upturn of current performance of the processing plant, ongoing optimization efforts and some new capital initiatives, the LOM plan assumes that the plant throughput will increase from $25.4 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2023 to $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2025 and thereafter. The annual plant throughput of $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ is planned to be achieved by increasing the milling rate to $3,474 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ and improving operating time to $92 \\%$.\n\nThe plant will produce variations in recovery due to the day-to-day changes in ore type or combinations of ore type being processed. These variations are expected to trend to the forecast recovery value for monthly or longer reporting periods.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.10 Infrastructure\n\nAll key infrastructure is built for the Detour Lake Operations; however some of the equipment is undergoing expansions.Potable water is supplied from lake and groundwater sources. Fresh water is sourced from a lake. Process water is recycled from the TMA.\n\nThe existing 180 km -long powerline runs from the processing facility to a tie in at Island Falls, and thence to the Pinard substation. The 230 kV transmission line allows for the distribution of more than 85 MW of power, suitable to service the entire Detour Lake Operations. In the event of a power failure, there is sufficient emergency power generation for the provision of basic services.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.11 Environmental, Permitting And Social Considerations\n\nThe Detour Lake Mine area has been subject to extensive baseline, environmental monitoring, and technical studies, as per provincial and federal regulatory requirements. The activities of the existing Detour Lake Mine operation are governed by several permits and approvals from applicable regulatory agencies.\nAdditional environmental permits, or amendments to existing permits, will be required to support ongoing operations, development, and proposed expansions to Detour Lake Mine. Required permits will be obtained prior to the commencement of applicable development or operating activities.\n\nMonitoring of various environmental factors has continued throughout the operating period, generating an extensive environmental dataset that supports site management, compliance tracking, and permitting activities.\n\nAgnico Eagle has undertaken ongoing consultation with the public, government regulators and its partnered Indigenous communities regarding the operations, environmental commitments, and planned activities.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.12 Markets And Contracts\n\nDoré from the mine is readily marketable, and contracts are in place for doré sales.\nCommodity prices used in Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are set by Agnico Eagle at the corporate level. The current gold price provided for Mineral Reserve estimation is US\\$1,400/oz, and US\\$ 1,650/oz for Mineral Resource estimation. Both Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates use an exchange rate assumption of $1.30 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\mathrm{\\$}$.\n\nAgnico Eagle has a number of contracts, agreement, and/or purchase orders in place for supply and services that are material to the operation. All contracts or agreements are negotiated with vendors and have a contractual scope, terms, and conditions. Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed. Contract terms are considered to be within industry norms, and typical of similar contracts in Canada with which Agnico Eagle is familiar.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.13 Capital Cost Estimates\n\nCapital costs consist largely of deferred stripping using a by-phase approach, construction of tailings cells and dam raises, mining equipment (replacements, additions, component replacements, capitalized maintenance), and sustaining capital for the process plant.\nCapital cost estimates are acceptable to support declaration of Mineral Reserves.\nThe LOM plan estimated total capital cost is $\\mathbf{C} \\$ 7,842$ million.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.14 Operating Cost Estimates\n\nOperating costs are based on actual costs seen during operations at site and are projected through the LOM using mostly zero-based budgeting principles. The consumables for the operation are based on a combination of current prices, contracts for future years and Agnico Eagle's view of long-term pricing, sourced from the previous life-of-mine plan, recent historical prices, and specialized third-party advisors. In general, approximately $87 \\%$ of operating costs are based in Canadian dollars and 13\\% have US dollar exposure. The exchange rate used in the financial model is $1.34 \\mathrm{C} \\$ /$ US\\$.\nOperating cost estimates are acceptable to support declaration of Mineral Reserves.\nThe LOM plan estimated total operating cost is $\\mathbf{C} \\$ 18,048$ million.\nThe LOM mining unit cost in C\\$/t mined is C\\$4.16/t ex-pit.\nThe LOM minesite cost in C\\$/t milled is C\\$22.05/t milled.\nThe LOM minesite cost in C\\$/oz produced is C\\$1,002/oz produced.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.15 Economic Analysis\n\nThis section is not required as Agnico Eagle is a producing issuer, the operations are currently in production, and there is no material expansion of current production planned. Mineral Reserve declaration for the Detour Lake Operations is supported by a positive cash flow.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.16 Risks And Opportunities\n\nThe major risks to the Detour Lake Operations are associated with:\n\n- Negative variations to the gold and diesel price assumptions;\n- Significant additional dilution or ore losses;\n- Significant delays in the assumed permitting timeline for the West Detour project;\n- Changes in the geotechnical assumptions;\n- Lower than planned plant production capacity.- Tailings cell seepage\n\nThe major opportunities are:\n\n- Additional modifications to the process stream that may generate a higher than $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ plant capacity;\n- Investigation of the underground potential at Detour Lake based on the results of the 2024 PEA;\n- Further improvements in the grade control processes with the installation of an assay laboratory at the mine site;\n- Increased level of automation in the mine operation (upgrade of the mine network to long-term evolution (LTE) enables higher level of automation);\n- Use of alternative energy sources to diesel with the intent of improving business sustainability and competitiveness;\n- Alternate tailings impoundment and treatment to reduce life-cycle costs and improve constructability;\n- Process water treatment and discharge to reduce water quality risks.\n\nAdditional opportunities include:\n\n- Potential to extend the known mineralization with additional drilling;\n- Interpolating density along the west part of the Detour Lake Mine will support geology modelling and add more precision to the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve tonnage estimates.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 25.17 Conclusions\n\nAn economic analysis was performed in support of estimation of Mineral Reserves; this indicated a positive cash flow using the assumptions and parameters detailed in this Report.\n\n### 25.182024 PEA\n\nThe results of the operating mine plan remain valid and represent a viable mine plan for the Detour Lake Mine, with the 2024 PEA assessing an alternative development option at a conceptual level.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.1 Mine Plan\n\nThe mining method selected for the 2024 PEA is transverse longhole open stoping.\nAccess to all underground workings will be via a main decline and conveyor ramp for material. The mineralized material will be transferred to the conveyor with trucks and material chutes.The proposed underground mine will be divided into regions according to their location in relation to the open pit. The mining sequence will advance multiple pyramids in a bottomup chevron sequence using primary and secondary stopes. Primaries will all be backfilled with cemented paste fill. Secondary backfill will be either cemented paste fill or waste rock fill according to the sequence and waste material available.\n\nThe ventilation system design is a push system capable of delivering more than $566.3 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{s}$ ( $1,200 \\mathrm{kcfm}$ ) of fresh air from surface to the underground workings.\n\nThe 2024 PEA mine plan assumes a five-year development period, a three-year operational ramp-up, and 12 years of production with an average mill feed of $11,200 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{d}$.\n\nThe equipment fleet selected is conventional for modern underground operations. The underground equipment fleet will be diesel-powered. A surface equipment fleet will complement the underground fleet bring in workers and manage the consumables on surface\n\nThe Detour Lake open pit is currently using a low-grade stockpile, and this represents an opportunity to increase the gold ounces production and limit the amount of waste rock tonnage to the WRSF, as the underground development material grading $0.3-1.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{t} \\mathrm{Au}$ could be directed to this stockpile.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.2 Recovery Plan\n\nThe process plant is based on a robust metallurgical flowsheet designed for optimum recovery with minimum operating costs. The flowsheet is based upon unit operations that are well proven in industry.\n\nWith the upturn of current performance of the process plant, ongoing optimization efforts and some new capital initiatives, the LOM plan assumes that the plant throughput will increase from $25.4 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2023 to $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ in 2025 and thereafter. The annual plant throughput of $28.0 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ is planned to be achieved by increasing the milling rate to $3,474 \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{hr}$ and improving operating time to $92 \\%$.\n\nAdditional initiatives have been identified to improve the process plant's operating flexibility further, and to mitigate risks associated with tonnage increases.\n\nAn underground tie-in for the process plant is required for the 2024 PEA. The crushing and grinding circuit is in place and operational; however, optimizations are planned or underway in support of proposed operations and the 2024 PEA. The leach and carbon-in-pulp, acid wash, stripping, electrowinning, and refining, thickening, and tailings circuits are in place and operational. No changes are envisaged in the 2024 PEA. Power, water, and reagent use is not expected to significantly change for the purposes of the 2024 PEA, assuming a $29 \\mathrm{Mt} /$ a production rate.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.3 Infrastructure\n\nMost infrastructure will be located directly at the mine site; however, some offsite infrastructure must be upgraded to accommodate the underground mine proposed in the2024 PEA. Additional infrastructure will include services and conveyor portals, conveyor, paste plant, mine administration and dry building, warehouse and maintenance shop, expansion of the existing accommodations camp, compressor room, ventilation and heating buildings, additional electrical distribution, additional allowances for information technology and site communication, and fuel storage.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.4 Market Studies And Contracts\n\nIt is expected that the 2024 PEA will use the same marketing methodology for doré production as the existing operations.\n\nThe gold price used for the Mineral Resource estimate was US\\$1,650/oz Au, with an exchange rate assumption of $1.30 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$$. The potentially-mineable stope shapes were constrained using a gold price of US\\$1,400/oz Au and an exchange rate assumption of 1.30 C\\$/US\\$. The 2024 PEA financial analysis used a gold price of US\\$1,900/oz Au and an exchange rate assumption of $1.34 \\mathrm{C} \\$ / \\mathrm{US} \\$$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.5 Environmental, Permitting, And Social Considerations\n\nExisting information on baseline, environmental monitoring, and technical studies is used in support of the 2024 PEA.\n\nThe 2024 PEA envisages that all of the tailings from the underground operations can be stored in the existing TMA or using the planned open pit storage, using existing facilities.\n\nThe 2024 PEA envisages that the current water management practices will continue for the duration of the 2024 PEA mine plan.\n\nPermitting for the underground operations is planned to be completed in two separate phases for advanced exploration and production. Accelerating the permitting for preliminary development will allow the development of the services portal and ramp to commence while the associated economic and technical studies are completed for full production.\n\nThere is considered to be no additional social or community impacts from the 2024 PEA, and assumptions based on the current mining operation apply to the 2024 PEA.\n\nClosure costs for the 2024 PEA are estimated at approximately C\\$40 M.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.6 Capital Costs\n\nThe total initial capital cost totals C\\$964.3 M, the sustaining capital estimate is C\\$993.2 M, and closure costs are C\\$40 M. The total estimated capital cost for the 2024 PEA is C\\$1,997.5 M.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.7 Operating Costs\n\nOperating cost forecasts total C\\$3.5 billion, averaging C\\$65.45/t of mineralized material processed.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.8 Economic Analysis\n\nThe project was valued using a discounted free cash flow approach. The net present value was calculated as at 1 April, 2024. A discount rate of $5 \\%$ was assumed.\n\nFinancial analysis of the underground project was prepared as the difference between a Base Case Scenario (\"Open Pit\") with process plant production at $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ and a scenario with additional production from underground starting in 2030, and a ramp-up in process plant production to $29 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ by 2028 (\"Open Pit + Underground + Mill Optimization\"). The difference between these two scenarios represents the differential value of Underground and the Mill Expansion (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\").\nThe differential value of adding the underground mine and mill optimization on the base scenario where processing production plateaus at $28 \\mathrm{Mt} / \\mathrm{a}$ (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\" model) has a cumulative free cash flow before tax estimated at C\\$4,552 M. The cumulative free cash flow after tax is $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 3,052 \\mathrm{M}$. At a $5 \\%$ discount rate, the net present value of free cash flows before tax is $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 1,971 \\mathrm{M}$ and of free cash flow after tax is $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 1,187 \\mathrm{M}$. The internal rate of return of the 2024 PEA is $18.3 \\%$ with an 11-year payback period.\n\nA sensitivity analysis of the differential value of underground and mill optimization (\"Underground + Mill Optimization\") was performed considering variations in gold price, exchange rate, operating and capital costs. Flexing based on gold grade processed was excluded because it reflects the same sensitivity as the gold price, given a flat gold price assumption. The undiscounted free cash flow after tax is negative at a gold price of US\\$1,070/oz. The net present value of free cash flow after tax is negative at a gold price of US\\$1,250/oz. The 2024 PEA is most sensitive to changes in the gold price and exchange rate, less sensitive to operating cost changes, and least sensitive to changes in the capital cost assumptions.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.9 Risks And Opportunities\n\nKey risks identified with the 2024 PEA include:\n\n- The limited percentage of Indicated Mineral Resources in the proposed mine plan;\n- Changes to the open pit mining sequence would affect the assumptions in the underground mine plan;\n- Water management and ground stability in proximity to historical underground workings;\n- Reliance on the proposed trucking haulage system to achieve proposed production targets;\n- Geotechnical risks.\n\nOpportunities include:- Mineralization remains open along the west end of the current deposit, and parallel to the chloritic greenstone unit and the structural splays coming out of it;\n- Upgrading Inferred Mineral Resources to higher confidence categories with additional drilling and supporting studies;\n- Delivering material that meets the low-grade stockpile cut-off to be potentially treated at the end of the proposed mine life.\n\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 25.18.10 Interpretation And Conclusions\n\nUsing the assumptions and parameters detailed for the 2024 PEA, which includes Inferred Mineral Resources in the PEA mine plan, the conceptual economic analysis returns positive economics."

    "text": "[[%~%]]\n## 26.1 Introduction\n\nTwo work programs are suggested, portions of which can be conducted concurrently.\nThe first work phase consists of surface drilling to potentially support mineral confidence classification upgrades and expand areas of known mineralization that could be potentially mined using underground methods. This phase would consist of about $260,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ of drilling, at an estimated cost of approximately US $\\$ 65 \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThe second work phase is broken into two subareas, which will be advanced concurrently. One will focus on ramp development to provide underground access and sampling points. The estimated cost for the ramp development and associated activities is part of an approved US $\\$ 100 \\mathrm{M}$ budget. The QPs concur with the program aims and budget allocation. The second will consist of engineering studies, and has commenced. Some aspects of the engineering studies will require input from the infill and expansion drill programs envisaged to be completed in Phase 1. The engineering studies will require a budget allocation of $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 10.8 \\mathrm{M}$, and this cost estimate was included as part of the 2024 PEA costs.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 26.2 Phase 1 Work Program\n\nA US $\\$ 65$ million work program is proposed to support potential mineral confidence classification upgrades and to expand area of known mineralization that could potentially be mined using underground methods\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 26.2.1 Infill Drilling\n\nIncluded in the work program is tighter-spaced drilling planned to support potential upgrade of Mineral Resources in the proposed area of the 2024 PEA.\n\nThis surface drill program would infill drill mineralization in areas currently classified as Inferred to a depth of about 600 m , provide information on mineralization included in the first five years of the 2024 PEA mine plan, and improve geological understanding of the deposit in the upper elevations. About $180,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ of drilling is suggested, requiring a budget of about US $\\$ 39 \\mathrm{M}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 26.2.2 Expansion Drilling\n\nDrilling from surface is also recommended along a west-plunging, near-surface, high-grade mineralization corridor adjacent to the conceptual stope outlines used in the 2024 PEA. A total of $80,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ of drilling is suggested, requiring a budget of about US $\\$ 26 \\mathrm{M}$.\n\n[[%~%]]\n## 26.3 Phase 2 Work Program\n\nThe second work phase is separated into two areas, work on which can be conducted concurrently.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 26.3.1 Exploration Ramp And Associated Activities\n\nAgnico Eagle has approved a US $\\$ 100 \\mathrm{M}$ budget to support data collection in support of proposed underground mining operations. Within this budget are the following discipline area allocations:\n\n- Surface activities in support of development of an exploration ramp: US\\$15 M;\n- Exploration ramp and associated activities: US\\$77 M;\n- High-intensity drilling: US\\$4.3 M;\n- Bulk sample: US\\$2.7 M.\n\n\n## Surface Activities\n\nActivities planned in support of the exploration ramp development include: earthworks, box cut excavation, portal construction, material procurement (such as portable ventilation unit, heater, compressor piping, electrical substation), temporary maintenance shop, temporary workers dry, and the exploration ramp services building.\n\n## Exploration Ramp\n\nThe approved budget will support development of a 2-km long exploration ramp to a depth of approximately 270 m . Other associated infrastructure and equipment activities that are included in the exploration ramp scope include ventilation raises, maintenance shop, water management system, mobile equipment, facilities complex, service building, workers dry, offices, warehouse, underground infrastructure, electrical substation, and a fuel tank farm.\n\n## High-Density Drilling\n\nA high-density drill study is proposed for Domain 53, which contributes a significant portion of the mineralization supporting the 2024 PEA. Drilling will be from surface, as the current ramp development assumptions would not see Domain 53 able to be accessed from underground until about 2030.\n\nThe program will also allow for improved geological, metallurgical, and geotechnical information well in advance of planned underground access.\n\n## Bulk Sample\n\nOnce the ramp has advanced sufficiently far to permit access to mineralization in Domain 54, a bulk sample of this material is planned. Ramp development will continue at depth below this zone.\n\n[[%~%]]\n### 26.3.2 Engineering Studies\n\nMore detailed engineering studies in support of potential underground development are required. Aspects of these studies have commenced. A portion of the engineering will require incorporation of the infill and expansion drill program data from the Phase 1 work program, when available.\n\nThe budget estimate to complete this work was included in the cashflow analysis in Table 24-24, and totals approximately $\\mathrm{C} \\$ 10.8 \\mathrm{M}$, allocated to the following general discipline areas:\n\n- Additional metallurgical testwork: C\\$0.5 M;\n- Geotechnical: C\\$3.4 M;\n- Permitting assessments: C\\$2.3 M;\n- Hydrology/hydrogeology: C\\$1.4 M;\n- Infrastructure design: C\\$0.5 M;\n- Mine design: C\\$0.3 M;\n- Technical service support: C\\$2.2 M;\n- Reporting and site visits: C\\$0.2 M."
